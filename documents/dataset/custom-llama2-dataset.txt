This serviceprovides the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Client in SmartWe. Followinginstallation, the ELO Integration Client is available as an iframe in correspondingly configuredobjects in the SmartWe application.When the ELO Integration Client is called within SmartWe, a configurable path is created (assumingone doesn't already exist) and displayed in ELO. This provides the user with the functions of theELO Integration Client, which can also be customized if required.ELO basics To use the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe and the ELO Integration Client within SmartWe, thesystems must meet the following requirements:ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 and higherDepending on the version, at least the following modules are required: ELO 23: ELOwf 23.00.000ELO 21: ELOwf 21.00.000ELO 20: ELOwf 20.05.000ELO 12: ELOwf 12.06.000ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.13.000 or higherInstalled and configured ELOauth plug-inCorrectly set SameSite flag (see ELO Integration Client documentation)The ELO license must also include the ELO Integration Client.â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â–ª â—¦ â–ª â—¦ â–ª â—¦ â–ª â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO for CAShttps://docs.elo.com/admin/integration-client/en-us/installation-operation/known-issues.html#samesite-flaghttps://docs.elo.com/admin/integration-client/en-us/installation-operation/known-issues.html#samesite-flagELO configuration First, you need to install and configure the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe in the ELO system.You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration. The ELOinstallation package contains the following files:crm.csw.integrationservicecustom_crm.csw.integrationserviceThe ELO Integration Client also requires a configuration file in ELOapps:elo.integration.Client'elo.integration.client' configuration file To use the ELO Integration Client, you need the configuration file elo.integration.client in JSONformat, which is stored in the Administration folder. You will find this configuration file under thispath://Administration//ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.ClientIf it does not yet exist, create it with the following parameters. This is essential for callingthe client.Alternative: If this file already exists because the ELO Integration Client is already being usedin other systems, you need to add the entry "csw".â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ "csw": { "noForm": false, "noFeed": false, "noFulltext": false, "noImagePreview": false, "rFInit": "RF_crm_csw_integrationservice_service_Init", "newDocVersFct": true, "saveDocFct": true, "gotoFct": true, "webClientURL":"http(s)://<ELOSERVER>:<PORT>/ix-<REPOSITORY>/plugin/ de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/web/", "editInOfficeFct": true, "removeEntryFct": true, "startWorkflowFct": false, "startWorkflowTemplates": null, "externalLinkFct": true, "folderMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E31)", "documentMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E30)",4 ELO for CAShttps://supportweb.elo.com/en-us/integration/elo-for-cas.htmlhttps://supportweb.elo.com/en-us/integration/elo-for-cas.htmlBe sure to check the following important parameters when creating or modifying the file:rFInit: Function that creates the folder path in ELO; provided with thecrm.csw.integrationservice package.webClientURL: URL to open the ELO Web Client when the GoTo function is enabled.

As soon asyou add a new entry, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadatamatching area. Lines are also created in the Assignment of user and group rights area.Object: In the Object column, enter the name of the object you are creating the configuration for.The selected object name must correspond to the SmartWe name of the object type (objectTypeattribute in SmartWe) that you want to configure the object type for.Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that mayhave to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column. You have the option tospecify it with the GUID or the name of the metadata form.Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use when filing from SmartWe.You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client configuration file, or a separate one foreach SmartWe object.Structure and metadata matching As described in the section General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, aseparate entry for the object is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching area.Object: This entry is copied directly from the Object column under General settings and can alsoonly be modified in this area.Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, youcan also enter SmartWe variables passed in the URL, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.7 ELO for CASELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata formdefined under Folder form. In our example, it is the Folder metadata form. Choose between GRP formetadata field and MAP for map fields and enter the technical name of the field here.ELO field: In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the technicalname. This is useful for transferring multiple values for a parameter passed from SmartWe, forexample.If the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost andwritten as a warning in the log.Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELOentry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curlybrackets.If the values are iterated, you can use the {i}</s> 
<s>identifier to indicate the Handlebars.Please noteIf an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenatedin this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.Key field: You can select one key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a property of theobject that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example, you canspecify an ID that uniquely identifies an object.This ensures that an object is not created twice (with a new name) in the repository, for example.Instead, the corresponding folder is found and a new path is created according to the new name.The folder and its contents are moved to this new path. The documents that were stored under theold name remain in the folder with the new name.8 ELO for CASConfiguration in SmartWe Before you can use the ELO Integration Service in SmartWe, you have to do some configurations inSmartWe.MethodSubscribe to the ELO Integration Service in the SmartWe App Store.In the SmartWe administration area, a new entry for ELO for SmartWe appears om the Administration tab.9 ELO for CAShttps://appstore.smartwe.world/details/smartdesignx.elo.integrationhttps://appstore.smartwe.world/details/smartdesignx.elo.integration10 ELO for CASClick the ELO for SmartWe button.Enter the URL of your ELO Indexserver in the dialog box.

You therefore needto install the ELOauth plug-in and configure it accordingly.You can download the ELOauth plug-in on the ELO SupportWeb. The installation process is describedin the ELOauth plug-in documentation.The plug-in is configured using a JSON file named de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json located in the ELOIndexserver configuration directory:Add the following entry to your ELOauth plugin-in configuration file and store your required values.The clientUrl parameter is passed to the /login/ request. It is redirected after authentication to callthe ELO Integration Client or ELO Web Client, for example.The parameter is available with ELOauth version 1.5.0.The values you need to enter for appKey and appSecret are provided by ELO. The <smartWEinstance URL> can be taken from your browser. This is the URL used to call your SmartWe instance.Example: https://beta.smartwe.deIn the example shown here, the mapping value is set to mail.

Immediately after copying the files, you will see an .EXE file thatstarts with EloJC.12 Client administrationRun the EXE file.The ELO ECM Suite Client Installation window opens.This installs the ELO Java Client along with all available optional</s> 
<s>components by default.InformationThe default entries for installation directory, profile name, and ELO Indexserver URL are justexamples of valid entries and usually need to be adjusted for your specific requirements.Although you can select or clear all options in this window, you can also modify the default settingsby changing the name and parameters of the .EXE file. The latter option is particularly useful fornetwork rollouts. The following is a list of possible installation options.13 Client administrationInstallation directory The ELO Java Client is installed to this directory when you run the program on a local computer. Youcan change the default directory by specifying INSTALLDIR="<path>" as the command lineparameter when you run the file.Profile name This is the name of the profile that the user sees when logging on to the repository with the ELOJava Client. You can enter any name here, but it is recommended to specify a name that helps theuser identify the repository they are about to use.Define the profile name by entering a text string to the space between the last underscore and the.EXE in the file name.ELO Indexserver URL This is the URL to the ELO Indexserver for your repository. Change the default URL by altering thefile name from ...http_localhost_9090_elo... to ...<http(s)>_<server name>_<port>_<repositoryname>.Select what you want to install: The ELO OCR service performs text recognition on image files,usually from the ELO Intray. The TIFF and PDF printer options install printer drivers that allowdocuments to be printed from or to ELO in each of the respective output formats. To select orremove each of these features from the AIO installer by default, change the .EXE in the part afterthe first underscore and add or remove J (Java Client), C (OCR service), T (TIFF printer), or P (PDFprinter).Select the programs you want to link to ELO with the macro: In this area, define which programs inWindows you want to install an ELO add-in to. The add-in provides you with additional in-programbuttons that send documents directly to the ELO repository or Intray. To change the defaults,change the .EXE file name in the same part as above and add or remove W (Microsoft Word macro), E (Microsoft Excel macro), I (Microsoft PowerPoint macro), and O (Microsoft Outlook macro).Configuration with file name You can configure the AIO program by renaming the installation file. This offers several options for arollout installation with predefined values.Please note Refer to the _Readme.txt_ file for instructions on configuration withthe file name. This file explains the various options that are available and thecorrect structure of the file name.14 Client administrationExample The order of the flags selected for the all-in-one installer does not matter.Example: The file name ...DWCJPE... selects the same options as ...JWDCEP....The file name must have the following format:<prefix>_<language>_<flags>_<http(s)>_<server name or IP>_<port>_<repository name>_<profilename>.exe15 Client administrationIf you make an error in the file name, you will see an error message. If you click OK, the installerwill still open, allowing you to perform a manual installation.Terminal server operation It is also possible to run the ELO Java Client in a terminal server</s> 
<s>environment.Memory Each instance of the Java Client is assigned 1 GB of RAM by default. This may require excessiveamounts of system RAM in terminal server environments. It is possible to reduce this value to 500MB in most environments without drawbacks.To do so, open the Windows Registry and search for ELOJavaClientw.exe.The registry key where this is stored also contains the parameter -Xmx1000m.Change this value to -Xmx500m.Please noteDo not change the memory settings for the ELO Java Client without first testing performancewith different document types in the actual repository. Reducing this value to less than 500MB is not recommended.macOS If you are installing the ELO Java Client on macOS, you need to consider the following information.Please noteIn rare cases, the macOS Gatekeeper prevents the execution of the ELO Java Client orfunctions such as PDF conversion even if a signature is valid. Apple sets a quarantine flag onthe app, which can be removed with the following command:sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ELOClient/ELOClient.app16 Client administrationJava Runtime Environment The ELO Java Client for macOS includes a Java Runtime Environment package. This means youdon't need to install the Java Runtime Environment separately.Installation The installation files are provided as a disk image file (DMG).

Use the function File to ELO (available in: Ribbon > File).For more information, refer to the Barcode recognition in the ELO Java Client chapter.93 Client administrationBasics Barcodes are used to encode characters and numerals. This enables you to uniquely assigninformation that the ELO Barcode module can read quickly and reliably, and then use thisinformation to index documents.One important aspect in filing documents electronically is assigning them the correct metadata sothat you can access the document without any problems at a later point in time. Errors in manualentry, such as entering incorrect customer or invoice numbers, result in unsuccessful searches. ELOBarcode simplifies and speeds up metadata entry and indexing processes.Overview of functions The main functions of ELO Barcode include:Automatic barcode recognition for scanned documentsConverting barcodes into search terms (indexing)The barcode is read during filing</s> 
<s>from the Intray to ELO. The following options are available:Defining a rectangular area in which the barcode is located (barcode area)Searching an entire documentYou can assign parts of the barcodes to different fields in the metadata form. You can also definethe characters of the barcode as a verification feature. During barcode conversion, ELO turns thisbarcode content into searchable attributes (metadata).â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 94 Client administrationFactors that affect barcode recognition Quality Scanners are grid-oriented devices that usually work with 200 to 400 dpi (dots per inch). If a grid-oriented device scans a symbol without a grid, valuable information is lost. There are many otherfactors resulting in additional loss of data or even in data distortion. Poor recognition results canonly be avoided if all the factors are considered to the fullest extent. The following factors must betaken into account to guarantee reliable barcode recognition:Barcode typeResolution (dpi)Barcode widthVertical barcode heightBarcode symbol alignmentQuiet zonesScanner settingsDocument qualityBarcode label qualityâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 95 Client administrationBarcode recognition characteristics Barcode recognition is primarily used to assign documents metadata. You can automate thisprocess to prevent any errors from occurring. System performance and data integrity depend onthe reliability of the device for barcode recognition as well as on the image quality. ELO Barcodeuses the best possible scanning algorithms. However, this alone does not automatically ensure ahigh rate of recognition. The preceding list therefore explains the individual factors that will helpyou achieve reliable barcode recognition.InformationDistorted or damaged barcodes can cause errors in barcode recognition.Barcode type The structure and design of a barcode symbol frequently lead to poor readability. Barcode type Code 39 seems to have the highest tolerance with a marginal corruption of the input data. This iswhy we recommend using Code 39.Resolution in dots per inch (DPI) Barcodes can be scanned reliably at a resolution of 200, 300, and 400 dpi. Lower dpi values requirelarger barcode symbols to achieve reliable recognition. For good results, we recommend you selectthe character density of the barcode symbols according to the values listed below.Recommended barcode width The width of the barcode is one of the most important factors for reliable barcode recognition. Thewider the barcode is, the better the symbol resolution and recognition.There is no formula to determine the best width for a barcode symbol. The general rule is not toexceed the following values:6 characters per inch (one inch = 2.54 cm) at a resolution of 300 dpi4 characters per inch (one inch = 2.54 cm) at a resolution of 200 dpiThese values include all the characters of a barcode symbol, such as synchronizing, data, start, andstop characters as well as the optional check digit.Vertical barcode height Theoretically, ELO Barcode is capable of recognizing a barcode that is only one scan line high.However, in reality the barcode symbols have different alignments, i.e., the barcode does not runparallel to the vertical and horizontal margins of a document. This is caused, for example, whenbarcode labels are applied manually, when the printer is not aligned correctly, or when the scanneris</s> 
<s>not aligned properly. Under normal circumstances, ELO Barcode reads the barcode from left toright.â€¢ â€¢ 96 Client administrationThe highest degree of reliability is achieved when the barcode is placed such that one horizontalscan line comprises the entire barcode symbol from start to stop character. To recognize the leftand right margins of the symbol in a single line, the barcode's vertical size needs to be largeenough to allow for a maximum angle ("angular position").Barcode symbol alignment If a barcode is placed on the document at an angle, this could cause a single scan line to missinformation (from start to stop character) of a barcode. ELO Barcode offers an alignment correctionoption for reading barcode symbols placed at an angle. The alignment correction function helpsrecover information from barcodes place at an angle. However, using the correction feature has adefinite impact on scanning speed. It can also cause scan errors. This is why we recommend onlyusing the function as a backup and not in normal operation.Quiet zones Most barcode standards require a "quiet zone" to the left and right of the barcode symbol. In abitmap image, this quiet zone should be entirely white. Noise ("dirty" pixels in the image) or text"shimmering through" and label edges often result in corrupted quiet zones. This can cause errorsin barcode recognition.A quiet zone at the top or bottom of a barcode symbol must have a height of greater than threepixels. The quiet zones to the left and right of the barcode symbol must be a minimum of eightpixels wide.Scanner settings Many scanners feature a contrast setting option. This threshold-value setting determines the shadeof gray when a pixel is no longer interpreted as white but as gray or black. This option allows youto adjust the scanner to the individual properties of the respective documents.Changing the threshold value could cause the black areas in the barcode symbols to appear wideror narrower than they really are. This process is also called "distortion". The barcode symbols maybecome illegible even if they look perfectly acceptable to the human eye.Barcode quality Keep the following in mind when placing barcode labels:The width of the labels should allow for quite zones around the barcode.The barcode resolution and display should be sufficiently dimensioned.The printing resolution should be 300 dpi or higher.Labels printed with matrix printers are not permitted.Label printers with ink ribbons are problematic.The glue must be of high enough quality to prevent the labels from rolling up or peeling off.The label paper must be thick enough to avoid "shimmering through" of text that is coveredby the label.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 97 Client administrationEnable barcode recognition RequirementELO Barcode is automatically installed along with the ELO Java Client.

The first level is contained entirely within ELO andis responsible for the recognition of the barcodes and the distribution of the recognized text to thefields of the metadata form. This is usually sufficient for most applications.If additional processing steps are required, a program can be run via the Microsoft VB-ScriptingHost interface, where these steps can be performed.Configure metadata form To process barcode documents with the ELO Java Client, you have to define a metadata form forcapturing barcode information in the ELO Administration Console.Go to Metadata forms and fields in the ELO Administration Console.Select the metadata form for barcode documents from the list.In our example, this is the Barcode metadata form.Optional: Create a new metadata form for barcode documents.Click the Barcode info area to edit the barcode data.100 Client administrationBarcode info input field Brief overview Check the Enable barcode recognition box.The Barcode info field is completed automatically. With the default settings, the entire pageis searched for barcodes (R(0,0,1000,1000)) and all pages of a document (P(0)).Barcodes are read via instructions. Instructions for targeted processing of barcodeinformation are defined in the Barcode info input field.Set your preferences under the options Scan area, Check, Scan and file, and Assign metadata.Your settings are automatically entered as instructions into the Barcode info input field. Please noteOnly a complete barcode instruction in the metadata form guarantees that barcodeinformation is read. Each barcode requires one R instruction, one T instruction, andone or more S instructions.Each entry group â€“ referred to as R group in the following â€“ is preceded by an R instruction.This instruction determines the area scanned for barcodes. This instruction may be followedby an L instruction, which can check minimum and maximum input lengths. This is followedby a T instruction that determines the barcode type and how barcode-free pages are handled.V instructions can then check certain barcode positions for fixed characters that you havedefined previously. A sequence of S instructions determines how the barcode is broken down101 Client administrationand assigned to the fields in the metadata form. The P instruction defines which page of adocument is scanned for barcodes. Another R group can follow after this.InformationGroup names must not be used multiple times in the metadata form.The instructions are explained in detail in the following.R instruction With the R instruction, you define the area on a page where the barcode information is located.Determine which area of the page is scanned for barcodes.Syntax: R(<left>,<top>,<width>,<height)The four coordinates of the R instruction define the checked area in per-thousandths of the totalscan area. An entry of form R(100,200,300,400) defines the area from the left = 2.1 cm, top = 6 cm,width = 6.3 cm and height = 12 cm on an A4 page (21*30 cm). Only this zone is scanned forbarcodes. If you want to check the entire input area, you can select the entire area by entering R(0,0,1000,1000).InformationIf you need multiple barcode areas on a page, add additional new</s> 
<s>R parameters to the Barcode info field.L instruction Use the L instruction to check the minimum and maximum length of a barcode.Syntax: L(<minimum>, <maximum)Barcodes usually have a fixed length (e.g., a 6-digit document number) per document. When youlimit the allowed area (such as L(6,6)) here, you can avoid incorrect recognition caused byincomplete or other barcodes.T instruction The T instruction defines the barcode type.Syntax: T(<type)Use the T instruction to define which barcode types you want the program to recognize. The valueis binary and entered as a hexadecimal value. The following options are available:Codabar 1 (0x1)Code 128 2 (0x2)102 Client administrationCode 39 4 (0x4)I 2 of 5 8 (0x8)EAN 13 16 (0x10)EAN 8 32 (0x20)UPC A 64 (0x40)UPC E 128 (0x80)Data Matrix 2048QR code 512PDF 417 536870912GS1 Databar 1073741824You can create any combination by adding the corresponding values (e.g., for Code 128 and Code39 = 2 + 4 = 6).Pages with no barcode: There are also pseudo-types with values 4096 and 8192 (0x1000 and0x2000). Type 4096 (0x1000) defines what to do with pages without barcode. If this type is not set,the page is ignored by the barcode manager. If this type is set, a barcode-free page is appended tothe previous page that has a recognized barcode (for multi-page documents).Consecutive pages: Type 8192 (0x2000) decides what happens with consecutive pages that haveidentical barcodes. With this type, such pages are summarized automatically. If this type is notused, all pages remain independent documents. These pseudo-types are only recognized in the firstR group and are then valid for all the forms used in a barcode process. You cannot use types 4096and 8192 at the same time. Either use type 4096 (collating pages without barcodes), type 8192(collating pages with identical barcodes), or none at all.Add blank pages 4096 (0x1000)Add identical pages 8192 (0x2000)Create checksum 16384 (0x4000)Scan direction: Last, a T instruction defines the scan direction of the barcode.

If you scandelivery notes, and your barcode consists of a delivery note ID ("DE" in the first two positions) anda delivery note number, you can avoid incorrect scans using the V(1='L') V(2='F') control. Withinan R group, you can define as many V instructions as required. Note that apostrophes (') must beplaced in front of and behind the check character.S instruction The S instruction assigns barcode information to a field in the metadata form. The group name ofthe field is used for the assignment. Multiple S instructions can be used.Syntax:S(<group name field>=<Startpos>,<number)The barcode is assigned to the fields using one or multiple S instructions. The S instruction defineswhich part of the barcode is transferred to which field (<group name of the</s> 
<s>field) via <startpos>and <number>. The group name of the field provides you with every field that has been assigned agroup name in the current metadata form definition. InformationGroup names specified in the metadata form must be unique. Group names must not beused multiple times in the barcode metadata form.If you fill a metadata form with multiple S instructions, these entries are saved without a separatordirectly one after another. If you have entered an ISO date (YYYYMMDD) in the barcode and want totransfer it to ELO, you must first change it to ELO format (DD.MM.YYYY or short DDMMYYYY). Youcan enter S(DLDATE=7,2) S(DLDATE=5,2) S(DLDATE=1,4). This is assuming that the date field isassigned to the first 8 characters of the barcode and that it will be entered into the DLDATE field.P instruction The P instruction defines which page of a document is scanned for barcodes.Syntax: P (<number of pages)InformationTo scan all pages of a document for barcodes, enter P (0) as the P instruction.Example R(0,0,1000,1000)T(1610685183)S(BAR1=1,50)S(BAR2=1,18)P(0)For the above example, the following information is evaluated and assigned:â€¢ 104 Client administrationThe R instruction defines the zone on a page where the barcodes are located.

This is how the barcode types are defined that shouldbe evaluated in the document.The two S instructions determine that two barcodes are applied to the fields with thecorresponding group name.The P instruction defines that all pages of the document are scanned for barcodes.Scan area Page only Determine what page of a document should be scanned for a barcode. To search all pages, enter the value 0. A P instruction based on your entry is automatically createdin the Barcode info field.Scan direction You can determine the scan direction of a barcode during recognition.The default is Left to right. This means if you do not use any special settings, barcode recognitionalways scans from left to right. Check Minimum/maximum length To filter out unknown barcodes, you can define a minimum and maximum length. Barcodes usually have a fixed length (e.g., a 6-digit document number) per document. If you limitthe allowed area here, you can prevent detection of unwanted or incomplete barcodes.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 105 Client administrationBarcode types Select the barcodes in the Barcode types list that are used on the documents with barcodeinformation. InformationYou will find more information on the different barcodes in the Barcode types chapter.Select all barcode types used in this way. You can enable all types with the Select all option.InformationIf you restrict the possible barcode types to a small number, this increases the processingspeed and reduces the error rate when recognizing the barcodes.Editing settings Checksum: Use this option to determine whether the checksum should be evaluated for a barcode.When you deactivate the option, the checksum of the barcode is ignored. The checksum is returnedwhen you enable this option. This option only works with barcodes that have a "built in" checksum,such as Code 128.Narrow quiet zone: Barcodes need free space around the barcode</s> 
<s>so it can be recognized. Whenyou enable this option, a border of 10 pixels is entered, otherwise the quiet zone is 10% of theimage resolution. 106 Client administrationScan and file Filing settings Ignore non-compliant barcodes: Exclude barcodes of the same type from the check. Documentswith multiple pages are read even more precisely to guarantee correct joining in ELO. You need to activate this option to exclude third-party barcodes.Add page without barcode to the previous page: Determine what will happen with barcode-freepages within a document with barcode information.This option adds a barcode-free page to the last page with a recognized barcode. If this option isdisabled, ELO Barcode will ignore pages without a barcode.Join pages with identical barcodes: Determine what happens to consecutive pages with identicalbarcodes. If this option is enabled, pages with identical barcodes are joined automatically. If thisoption is disabled, all the pages remain as separate documents.Image enhancements There are several options available to improve the quality of the scanned barcode. Despeckle: Removes scan noise. Median: Removes image noise in high-resolution scans. Oversampling: Improves the image quality in low-resolution scans. Noise reduction Noise reduction removes characters that are probably not part of the barcode. If the value is toolarge, parts of the barcode may be removed. A typical value is 10. 107 Client administrationAssign metadata Information The recognized barcode can be distributed over multiple metadata fields. Assign fields here.

We do notguarantee that this information is complete.EAN 13/EAN 8 EAN is the abbreviation for: European Article Numbering.Basic structure of an EAN barcode Two-digit country code + five-digit manufacturer + five-digit product no. + 1 check digit (forEAN13).The EAN barcode can only describe the numbers 0-9. Each character has 11 times the modulewidth. This barcode type basically provides ten different, defined sizes. EAN is used, for instance, insupermarkets because their data collection is extremely labor-intensive due to the large number ofarticles per customer.The European Article Number is printed on the packaging material of the product encoded asbarcode. Normally, an article number consists of 13 digits. However, an additional eight-digit shortsymbol was created for smaller articles (EAN 8).The first two digits of an EAN 13 code identify the country of origin (country code). Numbers 40-43stand for Germany. The next five digits identify the product's manufacturer. The next five digitscomprise the individual article number and classify the manufacturerâ€™s product. This number isassigned directly by the manufacturer. The final digit is the check digit and is determined bycalculating. EANs are assigned by GS1 Germany GmbH (www.gs1-germany.de).Code 39 This barcode is an alphanumeric code whose character set comprises the digits 0 to 9, 26 upper-case letters (A-Z), a space character as well as several special characters ($ â€“ + / . % ,). In thefollowing example, a barcode created with Code 39, contains the word "CODE 39:111 Client administrationEvery character consists of nine elements (five lines and four gaps). Of these nine elements, threeare wide and six are narrow. This feature allows for a self-test of Code 39. There is a gap betweenthe individual characters for separation purposes. The advantage of this code is the large characterset. Character combinations allow additional character representations. The drawbacks are the lowinformation density (8 mm) and the low error tolerance.Interleaved 2 of 5 (Code 25 Interleaved) This code is a variation of the original Code 25 which also has a character set of only digits 0 to 9.The objective is to save space by representing coded digits in pairs. Code 25 Interleaved has nointegrated check digit. Each digit is represented by five symbols (two wide and three narrow ones).The first character consists of lines, the second of gaps, the third of lines, then the fourth of gaps,etc.112 Client administrationCode 25 Interleaved offers, similarly to Code 39, advantages such as self-testing as well as highinformation density and the therefore resulting low storage requirement. The low tolerance andrepresentation of the usable symbols in pairs could be considered as a drawback. The start andstop characters contain only two symbols, which may lead to incorrect or partial recognitionbecause only an even number of characters can be represented.If an uneven number of characters is required, you have to place a zero in front of the code (123becomes 0123) or add a check digit.UPC A UPC (Universal Product Code) A is the 12-digit standard version of the</s> 
<s>UPC code. It is similar to theEAN code and is also referred to as UPC 12. The UPC is a numeric code that can display the digits0-9. Each symbol contains two bars and two gaps.The first digit of the UPC A shows the contents of the code:0: Normal, standard UPC code1: Reserved (possibly for later use)2: Products charged by weight. The barcode is created in the store to price a product.3: National Drug Code (NDC) and National Health Related Items Code (HRI)4: UPC code that can be used without formatting restrictions.5: Coupon6: Normal, standard UPC code7: Normal, standard UPC Codex8: Reserved for later use9: Reserved for later useâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 113 Client administrationThe second to sixth digits of the UPC identify the manufacturer of the product (UPC ID number).This number is assigned by GS1 US Inc. (www.gs1us.org). Digits seven to eleven of the UPCcomprise the individual part number and classify the manufacturerâ€™s product. The last digit (twelve)is the check digit which is determined by calculation.UPC E The UPC E is a numeric code that can display the digits 0-9. A UPC E has eight digits.

You cannot select</s> 
<s>multiple users or option groups.For a more detailed explanation of the settings, refer to the dialog box help feature.Please noteDepending on the operating system, not all functions may be available.122 Client administrationFunctions The following sections describe where you can find the ELO Macros functions and provides anoverview.InformationDepending on the external program and configuration, some functions may not be available.Call functions The location of the functions varies depending on the operating system.Microsoft Windows In Microsoft Windows, you will find the functions on the extra ELO tab in Microsoft Office programs.macOS In macOS, you will find the functions on the menu bar at the top edge of the screen. After the ELOMacros are installed, a scroll icon appears in the menu bar. The scroll icon opens a drop-down menucontaining the ELO Macros functions.IBM Notes In IBM Notes, you will find the functions in the File to ELO area.Overview of functions The ELO Macros provide the following functions.InformationDepending on the operating system, the names and icons for the functions may differ.ELO Transfer The ELO Transfer function files documents to ELO. You can set the filing location for the document inthe File new document dialog box. Click New folder to create a new folder for the document.Depending on the configuration, you must enter metadata for the document.E-mails that contain attachments with special characters in the name can be filed as separatedocuments.123 Client administrationAutomatically file to ELO The Automatically file to ELO function is intended for e-mails. This function allows you toautomatically file documents to ELO. To file e-mails automatically, you have to set the Filing targetfor sent e-mails and Filing target for received e-mails paths in the ELO Macros configuration.Transfer to ELO Intray The Transfer to ELO Intray button files documents to the ELO Intray. In the ELO Intray, you can editthe metadata and file the documents to the ELO repository.124 Client administrationELO search The ELO search function opens the Search work area in the ELO Java Client. The ELO Macrosautomatically transfer available metadata to the ELO search field. Clicking Start search begins thesearch.Configuration The Configuration function is where you configure the ELO Macros (see also chapter Configuration).125 Client administrationDynamic foldersWhat are dynamic folders? Dynamic folders are folders in ELO whose contents are generated dynamically. In principle, theseshow the results of a search. This search is performed using a specific SQL query. You can usedifferent search criteria (e.g. specific metadata). Every time something changes in ELO that isrelevant to the query, the contents of the dynamic folder change as well.Please noteIf you want to create dynamic folders, always test them first in a small test repository. Anincorrectly worded command can generate hits in the range of (total number of documents)* (total number of fields for all documents). A test repository may result in several thousandhits, while the hits in a productive repository could quickly reach into the millions.Please noteIf you want to use a dynamic folder in a live repository, you should give some thought toperformance. If the folder will be accessed on a</s> 
<s>regular basis, you need to make sure thataccess does not trigger any full table scans. To ensure this, you should analyze the SQLstatement (e.g. in SQL Server Management Studio).Dynamic folders in the ELO Java Client The ELO Java Client provides the option to save a search query as a dynamic folder.You will find this function under Search > Result > Dynamic folder. This documentation does not gointo detail on the function. You will find more information in the ELO Java Client documentation.126 Client administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/user/elo-java-client/en-us/elo-java-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folderhttps://docs.elo.com/user/elo-java-client/en-us/elo-java-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folderDynamic folders in the ELO Web Client The ELO Web Client also provides the option to save a search request as a dynamic folder.You will find this function under Search > Result > Dynamic folder. This documentation does not gointo detail on the function. You will find more information in the ELO Web Client documentation.Please noteQueries may vary depending on the database system. So you may have to makeadjustments to the change examples shown here.127 Client administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folderhttps://docs.elo.com/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folderCreate dynamic folders A dynamic folder is created by making a specific entry to a folder's extra text tab. This text mustbe placed at the very beginning of the field and no other text can be entered there. To prevent thefolder definition from being changed by mistake, only administrators should have write access tothe folder. Other users can be given read access to it. This restriction also helps you avoid childentries being manually stored in the folder, since they would not be displayed.!+[command] The !+ command is replaced at runtime with the SQL statement SELECT * FROM for the databasetable dbo.objects. You can define the WHERE part of the query following the !+ command.128 Client administrationMake sure you restrict your WHERE clause to the desired object types (assuming that they are notdefined by the other search restrictions anyway). You should also exclude deleted entries, which areall entries with an objstatus not equal to 0.Query multiple tables You can add other tables besides the objects table to the query. To do so, enter the other tablesfollowing a comma.Example 1 In this example, the query is restricted to the EMail metadata form (here: objmask = 2). The queryalso only searches for documents that have a specific name (here: Sorglos) in the From field (groupname: ELOOUTL1).Example 2 The following example runs a query that sorts the entries by two different fields. This means the objkeys table must be read twice.!+ , objkeys WHERE objid = parentidAND objmask = 2AND (okeyname LIKE 'ELOOUTL1' AND okeydata LIKE '%sorglos')129 Client administrationAn explanation of the individual lines of code:The table objkeys is entered twice under the names ok1 and ok2. Remember to insert the leadingcomma, otherwise you will get a syntax error at the SQL level and the target folder will remainempty.The objects base database table is linked to the two tables with the unique key objid.We want to read two specific fields, rather than any two fields (the internal field numbers *0 *and 1correspond to the first and second fields in the form).You only want to find</s> 
<s>documents with form type 5 that contain the value p1 in the first field.The documents are then sorted by the second field. All identical entries are sorted by the first field.Please noteThe example searches for the contents of any field that start with p1, i.Â e. that a result isalso generated if p1 occurs in a hidden field. However, the user will not see thecorresponding field. In a production system, you should give the field a specific name.Please noteThe objid=parentid part of the query is required in any case. This connects the basic datatable with the fields table. If you leave it out, you will get a long list of hits with entries thatare wrong.!?[command] A registered function must follow the !? command. The registered function must return a collectionof IDs or GUIDs that correspond to a repository entry. You can learn what a registered function isand how to create them in the documentation Adding functionality with registered functions.Example of a dynamic folder:The script file could look like this:!+ , objkeys ok1, objkeys ok2 WHEREobjid=ok1.parentid AND objid=ok2.parentid ANDok1.okeyno=0 AND ok2.okeyno=1 ANDobjtype=254 AND objmask=5 ANDok1.okeydata LIKE 'p1%'ORDER BY ok2.okeydata, ok1.okeydata!?RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere130 Client administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/en-us/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/en-us/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/!=[command] You can pass a saved search to the != command. However, the folder should be createdautomatically instead of manually. In the ELO Java Client, you can create a dynamic folderfollowing a search via Ribbon > Search > Result > Dynamic folder.To create a dynamic folder in your own IX application, you need to perform a search first. You willfind the corresponding text in the field FindResult.dynamicFolder, which is provided through the IXinterface.For example:Obsolete commands The commands !! and *!** are obsolete and are no longer supported in current ELO versions.function RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere(ec, args) { log.info("RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere(") var sord = args[0] log.info("sord=" + sord) var folderId = parseInt(args[1]) log.info("folderId=" + folderId) var db = new Packages.de.elo.ix.jscript.DBConnection() var ret = db.query( "select objectid from relation where parentid=? order by objectid desc", folderId log.info(")RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere" + ret) return retFindResult fr = ixConnection.ix().findFirstSords(â€¦);ixConnection.ix().findClose(fr.getSearchId());Sord sord = ixConnection.ix().checkoutSord(â€¦);sord.setDesc(fr.getDynamicFolder());ixConnection.ix().checkinSord(sord, â€¦);131 Client administrationAdditional notes Performance A search is initiated every time a dynamic folder is opened. With small databases (<50,000entries), you do not need to give any consideration to performance, as the SQL server optimizes allproblems away here.As soon as the database becomes larger, though, a badly formed search query will instantlygenerate a massive load on the database. This will result in lowered performance for all clients.You need to take the following into account:Is an appropriate index available for the selection criterion? If not, can one be created? If theanswer to both of these questions is no, you should probably avoid using dynamic folders. A fulltable scan can take over a half an hour on a large database.Does the SQL server use an index at all? Sometimes, the optimizer has a very different idea of howto process the query than the administrator. If the SQL server selects an unfavorable index, it maylead to long response times.Does the list of search results stay within reasonable limits? If you create a statement</s> 
<s>that collectsall documents filed within a month, this might work on a test system. However, if you want to view50,000 documents in a single folder on a production system, this will lead to poor results.Available columns The following columns are available in the base data:Column name Contentsobjtype Entry type, top-level folder=1, 2nd level=2â€¦ folders=253, document=254objshort Short nameobjidate Filing date in numeric format (number of minutes since Dec. 31, 1899)objxdate Document date in numeric formatobjkind Colorobjmask Document typeobjuser Document creatorobjstatus 0: not deleted, all other values indicate deleted entriesobjdeldate Expiration date in numeric formatThe objkeys table contains the following entries:ColumnnameContentsparentid Internal unique ELO entry number, connected to objid in the objects base table.132 Client administrationColumnnameContentsokeynoNumber of the field, starting with 0. There are a number of hidden fields startingwith index field 50.okeynameGroup name of the field. If you want to search independent of document type, usethe group name instead of the field number for selection.okeydata Content of the fieldokeyudata Content of the field in uppercase (Oracle databases only)Specific to Oracle SQL There are a number of aspects specific to Oracle SQL databases that you will need to take intoaccount. Otherwise, you will get incomplete search results or syntax errors.Oracle SQL distinguishes between upper and lowercase letters. If you search for "ELO" and thedatabase contains "Elo", Oracle will not find the entry. The okeyudata field enables you to search inmetadata fields.The repository name must be placed before the table names. Both parts are separated with aperiod.Example In Oracle SQL databases, you need to enter okeydata ok1 as repository1.okeydata ok1 in the query.133 Client administrationUsage examples Please noteQueries may vary depending on the database system. So you may have to makeadjustments to the following examples.Show documents added to the repository in the last 30 days Enter the following SQL query to the extra text field of the folder that you want to configure as adynamic folder.The individual components of the query:objtype>=254: Restricts the query to documentsobjstatus=0: Restricts the query to documents that are not deletedDATEADD(mi, objidate, '18991230'): Searches for the filing date (objidate) in minutes (mi)since the reference date (December 30, 1899).InformationThe ISO date was selected here to avoid possible conversion problems. In English-languageinstallations, MM/DD/YYYY usually works as well.>=: The operators restrict the search to documents with a filing date later than or equal tothe current date minus 30 days.DATEADD(day, -30, SYSUTCDATETIME()): Here the system date is read out in UTC format(SYSUTCDATETIME()) in days (day). 30 days are then subtracted from that.InformationThe SYSUTCDATETIME function was not available until SQL Server 2005.

Thebasic syntax is as follows:elodms://<ELO GUID>You can find an entry's GUID on the Options tab of the metadata form.Enter the GUID enclosed in parentheses, such as:elodms://(C1128681-C328-DE51-C99E-FA463C6C6911)An entry's GUID can be called in the internal scripting with the following:elodms links with annotation number An elodms:// GUID link can be constructed with an instruction to jump to the page number of aspecific annotation. The basic syntax is as follows:elodms://<ELO GUID>@A<annotation ID>var item = â€¦ // arbitrary code to select an ArchiveElementvar sord = item.sord;var guid = sord.guid;â€¦137 Client administrationThe easiest way to get this information is to right-click an annotation and select Rememberposition from the context menu. This copies the name of the document and the annotation'sposition to the system clipboard. Delete the part of the string before elodms://</s> 
<s>to get the requiredlink.elodms links with page number elodms:// GUID links can also be instructed to jump to a document page. The basic syntax is asfollows:elodms://<ELO GUID>@P<Page number>In this case, the numbering starts at 1. If an invalid page number is specified, the link automaticallygoes to the first page of the document.elodms object ID links The ELO object ID can also be used instead of the GUID:elodms://<ELO object ID>If the object ID is used, it is not possible to set anchors for annotations and page numbers.elodms workflow links elodms links with wf at the start jump automatically to a specific workflow in the client. The basicsyntax is as follows:elodms://wf/<workflow ID (int)>/<node ID (int)>138 Client administrationIf the node ID is 0 or missing, the link attempts to go to the first available (unprocessed) node inthe workflow.The ELO Java Client does not display the workflow ID or node ID using built-in functions.

The browser must support the latest HTML5, CSS, and JavaScriptstandards.InformationConfigure the browser to allow cookies and enable JavaScript.The System requirements contains information about which browsers are currently supported.Though the ELO Web Client is generally supported by older browser versions, we recommendedusing the latest versions for better performance.Information<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-83 Client administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/https://docs.elo.com/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/https://docs.elo.com/ops/requirements/en-us/overview/clients.html#elo-web-client-23https://docs.elo.com/ops/requirements/en-us/overview/clients.html#elo-web-client-23When using Internet Explorer, icons may not load correctly. In this case, the default icons aredisplayed instead.ELO Indexserver access The ELO Indexserver must be directly available for the browser (see section ELO Web ClientInternet Access).Single sign-on The single sign-on (SSO) function is run automatically via the ELO Indexserver. You do not need toconfigure this in the ELO Web Client.Installation The ELO Web Client installed using the ELO Server Setup (see separate documentation).ELO Web Client Internet Access To work with the ELO Web Client both via the intranet and the Internet, ELO Web Client InternetAccess has to be configured accordingly.Refer to the separate section for information on the configuration of ELO Web Client internetaccess.Starting the program The ELO Web Client offers a number of options to start the program.For more information on starting the program for the first time, refer to the Start pages and entrypoints chapter.Manual logon Manual logon does not require additional settings. You access the manual logon page via a URLwith the following format:http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/4 Client administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/ops/onprem/en-us/installation/setup/https://docs.elo.com/ops/onprem/en-us/installation/setup/Administration This chapter contains information on administrative tasks in the ELO Web Client.Configuration You can make a number of settings on the configuration page of the ELO Web Client.You can access the configuration via User menu [your name] > Configuration.Categories The settings on the configuration page are divided into categories. When you open a category, yousee the settings of the selected category. The settings are grouped by topic within the category.You will find an i with additional information next to each setting.Configuration sets The different settings are separated into groups. These groups are called configuration sets.As the main ELO administrator, you have the right to manage all configuration sets. You can assignconfiguration sets to or remove them from users and option groups.InformationEach user only sees the settings that were assigned to</s> 
<s>them via the configuration sets. Onlyyou will see the sets themselves.The following configuration sets exist:â€¢ 5 Client administrationRed circle: Refers to administrative settings that have a significant impact. This set should berestricted to administrators.Blue circle: Refers to the settings that have a significant impact.Green circle: Refers to settings that do not have a significant impact.Next to each setting, you will see which set they belong to.Assign configuration setsTo assign a user or group a configuration set, proceed as follows:Click Select user and select the user or the group.Click the Configuration sets category and select the desired configuration sets.The changes are saved automatically.Who do these settings apply for? First, you need to select who you want to change the settings for. The following modes areavailable:My configuration: All settings only apply to your own account. The configuration opens in this mode.Create configuration for user/group: The settings apply for a certain user or users in an optiongroup. To select this mode, click the Select user button and choose a user or an option group.Please noteOption groups cannot be used to transfer permissions.Create global configuration: The settings apply for all users. To select this mode, click the Selectuser button and choose Everyone.ImportantWhen you have changed a setting, leave the check box to the far left selected. If you clearthe check box, the ELO Web Client restores the default settings.â€¢ â€¢ 6 Client administrationApply ribbon settings This function enables you to apply the functions of the ribbon for another user or another optiongroup.Click Select user and select the user or the group you want to apply the ribbon settings for.Click Apply ribbon settings. Here, select the user or group whose ribbon settings you want toapply.The functions on the ribbon of the two users/groups are now identical.Inheritance hierarchy of the settings The ELO Web Client verifies which settings apply for which user at three levels. If there is anindividual setting for a user, ELO uses this setting. If there are no individual settings for a user, theELO Web Client checks whether the user is a member of an option group. If this is the case, thesettings of the option group apply. The default values apply if no settings have been configured.Custom user settings: This item only appears if you create a configuration for an option group. Usethe Remove custom settings button to make sure that all users of an option group have indeedbeen assigned the same settings.7 Client administrationPlease noteThe Remove custom settings action is required if the members of an option group havepreviously had access to certain settings. If you now remove a configuration set from anoption group, this option group has fewer settings to choose from. Changes made up to thispoint must be overwritten once.Home screens and entry points The ELO Web Client has multiple start pages and entry points. Each entry point redirects to therespective start page. Different functions and areas are available depending on the start page.InformationThe default language is determined based on your browser's language setting. However,you can change the language</s> 
<s>in the logon dialog box or in the start parameters.Start pages Choose from the following start pages:Main pageDirect viewMain page This page offers the full functionality of the ELO Web Client.The following entry points are also available for the main page:Manual logon http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/You will be redirected to the logon page. You must enter your user name and password.If logon is successful, you will be redirected to the main page of the program. If logon fails, acorresponding error message is shown. In this case, correct your logon data and click OK.InformationIf you are logging on manually, the name you entered stays the same when you change thelanguage settings or log on to the system again.â€¢ â€¢ 8 Client administrationAlternative (start parameters possible) http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/login.htmlExample: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/login.htmlThis entry point also redirects you to the logon page. You can add other start parameters to theentry point, which will affect various settings (e.g. client language, start page, etc.).Single sign-on (SSO) http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/sso.htmlExample: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/sso.htmlThis page uses SSO to log on to the repository. If logon is successful, you will be redirected to themain page of the ELO Web Client. Otherwise, it will revert to the manual logon page.Alternative (start parameters possible) http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/login/index.jspExample: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/login/index.jspThis entry point provides an alternative to SSO. You can add other start parameters to the entrypoint, which will affect various settings (e.g. client language, start page, etc.).Direct view This is not a start page in the conventional sense but more of an interface that you can opendocuments in. This requires a GUID as an additional parameter that automatically provides thebrowser with a link that refers to the document with the GUID entered. If the browser cannotdisplay the document, then a message or pop-up window will appear, depending on the browsersetting.Use the following entry point for direct view:Log on with GUID http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/guid.jsp?guid=<GUID>Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/guid.jsp?guid=(4BE6C7FB-7F13-4297-93E5-3A26AD22EFEF)For compatibility reasons, this logon redirects you to the direct view. You also need to enter a GUIDas a parameter.9 Client administrationAccess via start parameters You can enter additional parameters for some logons. These parameters are attached to the URLwhen called. Always separate the first parameter from the URL with an ?. All additional parametersare separated with an &. The respective value is specified with an =.http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/ix/login.jspFor example: http://ELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/ix/logon.jsp?locale=fr&user=AndersonThe following parameters are available:locale: Determines the language setting for the current session. The ELO Web Client currentlysupports the following languages: Danish, German, English, Finnish, French, Greek, Indonesian,Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Serbian, Slovakian,Spanish (International), Spanish (Latin America), Czech, Turkish, and Hungarian.startPage: Determines the landing page that opens after logging on. The following values areallowed: main page = 1, and direct view = 3.GUID: GUID of a document, required for the document view and can be specified for the main page.Enter the GUID of a document in parentheses, e.g. (9C0E2DA7-C1C6-4856-90D7-A50DA876F252).Log on with authentication start parameters http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/ix/urlLogin.jsp?user=<user name>&pw=<password>Enter the parameters for the user name for this logon page (user) and password (pw). After SSO,additional parameters are evaluated and you are then redirected to the corresponding start</s> 
<s>page.Please noteThis logon page displays the user name and password in plain text. If Secure Socket Layer(SSL) was enabled, the parameters are encrypted but will still appear in plain text in thebrowser or in the browser history. This also applies for server logs.Settings via the ELO Application Server Manager Use the ELO Application Server Manager or the URL <server>:<port>/web-<repository name>/statusto call the ELO Web Client status page.For example: http://ELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/statusThis page shows the installed client version.

<s>view for intranet sites is disabled by default.Configuration file When you install the ELO Web Client, a service account reads the configuration files. Theinstallation process writes the entries to the configuration file of the ELO Web Client, config.xml.The password is encrypted.You can also make these settings manually by entering the corresponding values for configUserand configPwd.Change the password for the service account If you changed the password for the service account, enter the changed password to configPwd.Optional: To enter your password encrypted, use the password.bat help program from the ELOServer Setup directory.Please noteIf you enter the password for the service account unencrypted, a message will be issued inthe log file of the ELO Web Client (example: web-arc-001.log) along with an indication of theencrypted password. Enter the encrypted password string to the config.xml configuration fileunder configPwd.15 Client administrationScripting API A scripting API was developed for the ELO Web Client to enable developers to program extensions.The interface is currently restricted to the start page of the client.The Web Client Scripting Base folder is located in the Administration folder of the repository.Relevant files will be read from this folder.If this folder is not available, you can create a Scripting Base folder on the relevant page in theELOprofessional Application Server Manager. Normally, the Web Client Scripting Base folder iscreated when ELO is installed.All scripting, CSS, and image files are read and loaded dynamically when a user starts the mainpage of the client (if the user has sufficient rights).Development Some functions have been integrated to help you work with the interface. These are explained inthe following section:DevMode: This enables you to activate developer mode. You will need to change the relevant entryin the settings of the ELOprofessional Application Server Manager.In developer mode, all JavaScript files will be loaded separately when starting the main page. Thismakes troubleshooting much easier. In addition, the folder dev (in the ELO installation directoryunder ...\server\webapps\web-\<repository name\>\dev) is checked for additional script, CSS, andimage files. These files are integrated dynamically when starting the main page.Please noteWe do not recommend using developer mode in productive systems.16 Client administrationELO Web Add-onsIntroduction This documentation describes how to install and configure the ELO Web Add-ons program.ELO Web Add-ons expand or change the scope of functions of the ELO Web Client. You will find adescription of the new and changed functions in the ELO Web Client manual.17 Client administrationDownload You can download the ZIP file from the ELO master DVD or the ELO SupportWeb.Content of the ZIP file:Name DescriptionELO Web Add-ons.msi Installation wizardSetup.exe Allows you to choose the language for the installation wizardreadme.txt Brief installation instructions*.mst These files are exclusively for selecting a language for Setup.exe18 Client administrationInstallation After you have extracted the ZIP file, you have several options to install the program.Please note that you have to perform the installation as an administrator.Manual installation Run the setup and follow the instructions of the installation wizard.Automatic installation Use the MSI file.19 Client administrationTechnical settings After successful installation, the program will start. You will see an icon on the</s> 
<s>taskbar.The program starts automatically when you boot Windows. To start the program manually, you canrun the start file in the installation directory.In the context menu of the taskbar icon, you can open the log file or enable/disable debug logoutput, among others.You can also close the program via the taskbar icon. The icon then disappears.Registry entries By default, the Apache HTTP client is used for communication, as this makes SSO authenticationmore reliable. To use the default HTTP client instead, you can add the following name with thevalue true:The program creates the following key in the registry:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Prefs\Elo Digital Office\elowebaddonsYou can enter different values in this key to configure program settings.The program has to be restarted after every change made to the registry entries for it to takeeffect.Time interval for deleting temporary files The program regularly deletes temporary files accumulating during use. To set this time, you canadd a value with the following name:HTTP port By default, the program uses a specific port for communication via the HTTP protocol. To changethis, you can add a value with the following name:You do not have to enable ports specifically as the installation wizard creates a correspondingfirewall rule.use\_default\_http\_client\_factorytemp\_deletion\_interval\_secondshttp\_port20 Client administrationHTTPS port To enable communication via the HTTPS protocol, you can add a value with the following name:The program gives HTTPS priority over HTTP.ImportantIf you have to change a port, you also have to configure it for all users that do not use SSOin their ELO user profiles. In the profileopts table, create the entry elo.webaddons.HTTP\_PORTor elo.webaddons.HTTPS\_PORT.Path to the keystore To use HTTPS, you will have to configure a keystore with a corresponding certificate. For the path tothis keystore, you can add a value with the following name:Password for the keystore To use the keystore, you have to configure the password. For the password, you can add a valuewith the following name:When you start the program, it checks whether the password is encrypted. If not, a log output iscreated as a recommendation containing the encrypted variant.https\_portkeystore\_pathkeystore\_password21 Client administrationTroubleshooting No communication between ELO Web Client and ELO Web Add-ons Make sure the ELO Web Client has loaded after the ELO Web Add-ons program is ready foroperation.Using the browser console, check whether the ELO Web Client is using both the correctprotocol and port. You can configure the port used by the ELO Web Client in the profileopts table, while theport for the ELO Web Add-ons program is configured via a registry entry (see above).These settings must match.If you have configured HTTPS and are using self-signed certificates, your browser mayclassify the connection as unsecured. You will recognize this by an error message in the ELOWeb Client browser console. In this case, you will have to add the connection in the browseras an exception.â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â€¢ 22 Client administrationInternet accessBackground To use the ELO Web Client both locally on the Intranet as well as remotely over the Internet, youneed to configure the server specifically.

ELO iSearch in practice Technical description Glossary Filing definitionFiling definition Background reindexIntroduction Installation 2 Configuration and administrationELO iSearch guideWhat does ELO iSearch offer? The ELO ECM Suite provides an efficient solution for retrieving information and locating relevantdata, even with large quantities. The most important matches are found quickly and conveniently.Various search functions ensure that you can access the documents you need as well asinformation from any integrated third-party applications, such as ERP, CRM, or e-mail systems. ELOiSearch helps you find information faster by automatically completing search terms as you type,correcting typing errors, and searching for similar or related terms.In addition, when you search for contract, ELO iSearch will also suggest synonyms such as agreement. Even if the search does not return a unique search term, ELO iSearch gets you theresults you want, suggesting terms that are related to the original query. Intelligent dictionariesbreak compounds such as insurance policy down into their basic forms. The words can also beconverted back to their root form so you no longer have to worry about plurals, inflected forms, orother compound words when entering search terms â€“ the search engine does this in thebackground.If the user enters policiy instead of "policy", ELO iSearch displays the message: Do you meanpolicy?" These intelligent assistance systems pick up on typing errors, improving the searchresults or in some cases ensuring that there are any hits at all.Search queries using structured metadata search tools are often very precise and very specific.Searching for an invoice, contract, or quote number in the whole repository produces fast andreliable results.Another challenge is to save frequently used, recurring, or complex search queries withcomplicated filter options and being able to apply them quickly and conveniently as needed. Thetiles introduced with ELO ECM Suite 10 for saving and managing search favorites provide theperfect solution to this problem.3 Configuration and administrationELO iSearch in practice Basic principles and the dual strategy ELO iSearch ELO iSearch enables full text searches, that is, of the text within a document as well as additionalinformation such as metadata. It provides various options to extend the search to different areas.ELO iSearch analyzes and processes full text using search rules and patterns (algorithms).A special search index is automatically created and updated in parallel to the SQL database. Thisensures fast response times, even for complicated search queries. However, this also results in aminor delay before new documents can be found using ELO iSearch. Normally, this delay should beless than one minute.The following sections apply to the use of ELO iSearch in the ELO Java Client.Metadata searchÂ The metadata search is a second search option for special requirements. It searches for the valuesexactly as they are entered right in the SQL database, meaning no delays.Compared with ELO iSearch, it may deliver different results for the same search input. Typically,ELO iSearch will return more hits than the metadata search since language-specific search rulesand patterns also finds plural forms of a search term,</s> 
<s>for example.Generally, ELO iSearch takes the more modern, flexible, performant approach and is the preferredsearch variant in ELO.Full text search Full text refers to all the text content within a document. On an invoice, this would be not only thename and address of the recipient, but also the name and address of the issuer, the invoice items,amounts, and any payment instructions.Linguistics Linguistics focuses on the meaning and rules of human language. Based on such rules, ELO iSearchapplies automated methods that prepare texts in such a way to allow them to be found as easilyand conveniently as possible. As a result, documents with relevant contents can be found usingsimple search terms. Therefore, it is not necessary to know exactly how the word is written withinthe document. This is especially practical when a word has several different spelling variants. Inthe following, this will be referred to as language and search rules in the context of searchpatterns.4 Configuration and administrationBreakdown of compound words Compounds are a union of two or more words. Compounds such as insurance policy, function as asingle unit of meaning. They can be broken down into their components, in this case insurance and policy.Root forms When processing the query, the singular is derived from the plural form, or the infinitive of declinedverbs is found.ExampleFor example, when searching for invoices, invoice is also queried. However, it is not possible toform a plural from the singular of a word. The table below illustrates this and will help you to selectand enter your search term.Please noteCompound words are broken down and root forms are created during indexing. To use thisfeature, you have to enter the root form as the search term. If you use an inflected form asthe search term, this exact form will be used for the search. The following table containssome examples.Full text Search term ResultsInvoices Invoices YesInvoices Invoice YesInvoice Invoices NoIncoming invoices Incoming invoices YesIncoming invoices Invoices NoIncoming invoices Invoice YesInvoice Invoice YesLanguages You need to keep in mind that all search rules depend on the language used. In English, a plural isusually formed by adding an 's' (for example, book and books), but in German there are severalvariants and also many irregular forms (one Buch but several BÃ¼cher).ELO iSearch also applies different rules depending on the language. As a result, not all search rulesand patterns are available to the same extent in each language. Most language rule and patternoptimizations apply to the German language. English is also supported.To automatically process documents, the language of the full text is initially determined based onthe words they contain. These words are used to process the text with search rules and patterns.This can become problematic in documents that contain multiple languages.5 Configuration and administrationThe metadata fields are always processed with the set/selected repository language.Multi-word searches If you enter multiple words into the search field, the search looks for documents containing all ofthese words. This means each additional word you enter narrows down the search, ideally helpingyou to find just the right document.To search</s> 
<s>for multiple alternative terms, separate them using a comma, for example businesstrip, customer appointment. In this case, only one of the search terms has to appear in thedocument.Please noteFor the multi-word search to work, all searched terms must be contained in one area (see Search area/fields searched). Searching for seating plan in all search areas finds documentscontaining the words seating and plan either both in the full text, both in the metadata, orboth in the feed. You would not find any documents containing the words in separate areas,i.e. one word in the full text and the other in the metadata.Phrase search It is possible to search the document for not only individual words, but also for entire sentences byplacing related words in quotation marks. The full text must contain these words in the exact order.Searching for John Smith finds this exact name. Without the quotation marks, documentscontaining the words that are not right next to one another, for example, John Cramer accompaniedHelen Smith would also be found.Thesaurus ELO iSearch has a built-in thesaurus that lists synonyms of the entered search term. They appearas soon as a word has been entered followed by a space.Select a synonym to apply it to the search field as an alternative. Companies can customize theirthesaurus. It is also possible to remove suggestions. Refer to the Integrating custom thesaurusessection.6 Configuration and administrationSearch area/fields searched The options for restricting or extending the search to specific areas are located next to the searchterm field and the Start search button. This allows you to choose the area or areas you want tosearch for the words in. You can choose between the areas Full text, Metadata, and Feed. The Metadata area is split up into Short name, Fields, and Extra text. The default setting searches in allareas.InformationAs described above for the full text search, all fields are searched using the same searchrules and patterns. This means root forms are identified and compound words are brokendown first.Full text With digital documents, the full text is always the text exactly as it is in the document. Full textsearches can therefore find all the contents of a document. Unlike the metadata search, the fulltext search is ideal for finding any term within the document, and not just defined keywords ormeta information.Scanned documents have to be converted into text form using OCR first. In some cases, letters orentire words may not be recognized correctly, which can prevent the document from being found.Text blocks and columns may cause sentences to be mixed up, meaning a phrase search will notfind the sentence.Short name Documents and folders are shown in ELO with their short name. For this reason, the short nameshould be the most accurate description of the content as possible.7 Configuration and administrationFields When the Fields setting is enabled, all configured fields in all metadata forms are included in thesearch. For example, searching for Jones will return different results:Jones Materials Ltd. in the Supplier fieldSusan Jones in the Customer field42 Jones Street in the Address fieldExtra</s> 
<s>text The extra text tab in a metadata form allows you to add further information on a document orfolder in ELO. Unlike a normal field, it provides space for longer texts and can be searched.Feed When Feed is selected, all posts and comments in the feed are searched in text form.InformationThe feed also contains the version numbers and version comments for both the currentworking version of a document and older versions.Filters In many cases, it makes sense to incorporate structured information into the text-only search inorder to narrow down the search range. ELO iSearch provides filters for this. Users can enable thesefilters on the ribbon, which then show up as additional buttons below the input field.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 8 Configuration and administrationA range of filters are shown below the search field by default. These are the most frequently usedfilters. Refer to the section on search favorites to find out how to set them universally, specific togroups, and individually.Selecting the button opens the respective filter and allows you to set special search specifications.It is almost always possible to make an entry via mouse or keyboard.Just like the search, the filters take into account permissions set in ELO. Only the filter values forthe entries the user is permitted to see are shown.Entry type As with the metadata form filter, the entry type filter shows a list of possible values. It is used inthe same way, with search-as-you-type, autocomplete, or selection from the list. Unique to theentry type filter, Documents and Folders are always shown at the top, and combine all thecorresponding entry types.9 Configuration and administrationDate/filing date The filter for dates in the metadata offers a range of options for searching for a date. Searchesalways apply to an entire day, i.e. from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.10 Configuration and administrationAt the top of the figure, you will see an input field where you can enter an exact date. The ELO JavaClient uses the date formats set in the configuration here. You can enter a time range using threeperiods to separate the dates, e.g. May 1, 2020...May 10, 2020. Complete your entry by pressingthe ENTER key. The filter closes, and the time range is shown in a small gray box.A more convenient way to enter a time range is using the Range mode with two input fields. Afterentering a from value, the focus automatically jumps to the to field, and you can complete bothfields by selecting a date in the calendar.If the entry is not recognized as a date, the filter remains open when ENTER is pressed and theinput field turns red to indicate an error.11 Configuration and administrationRelative time ranges can also be entered. Use plus and minus signs to set a time range in days,starting with the current date. Entering -2 searches everything from two days before at midnightuntil 11:59 p.m. of the current day. Adding m allows you to use months. +1m searches everythingfrom the current day at midnight to one month in the future (28, 29, 30, or 31 days depending</s> 
<s>onthe month and year).On the left, there are five buttons with typical time ranges. After being selected, the time range isentered to the input field in order to show the syntax used.Dates can be selected using the calendar on the right. The current date is displayed in red.Navigate between months and years using the arrows above the calendar. You can select therequired month or year using the respective pull-down menus for the month field and year field.Select an individual day with the mouse. Press the SHIFT key and mouse click on a second day toselect a time range.12 Configuration and administrationThere are two more buttons at the bottom left that allow you to switch between the calendar andthe year overview in the form of a list. The list form shows all available year values as well as thenumber of associated entries to the right in parentheses. You can select a single year (by selectinga list entry) or several years (by selecting the check boxes).13 Configuration and administrationFiled by/editor The Filed by and Editor filters are similar to those for the metadata form and entry type. The usercurrently logged onto ELO is shown at the very top.Metadata form The filter shows all metadata forms in use as well as the number of associated entries to the rightin parentheses. The metadata forms are sorted by alphabetical order. You can select a single formor multiple forms using the check boxes.14 Configuration and administrationWhen you enter text into the filter field, the search-as-you-type function automatically starts. Yourcurrent entry is instantly compared with possible values. This narrows down the list so that onlymetadata forms containing the entered text are shown. It does not matter where the text appears.In the following example, entering In finds both Invoice and Marketing. The matching text is thenhighlighted in light yellow.When typing, autocomplete also provides suggestions. Your entry is interpreted as the beginning ofthe metadata form name, so the matching form with the most entries is entered to the input fieldas extra text and selected. Press ENTER to accept and apply the autocomplete suggestion, or keeptyping to search for another metadata form.All fields This filter searches all configured fields in all metadata forms. It uses the same linguistic rules asthe iSearch input field and provides an easy way to differentiate between searches in the full textdatabase (via input fields) and in the metadata (with this filter).If you want to find related terms, numeric values, or dates, it is better to restrict the search to aspecific field.Select field You can manually add filters for specific fields. In the dialog box, first select the metadata form,then the fields. If you have already narrowed down your search to a form using a form filter, this ispre-selected in the dialog box.15 Configuration and administrationInformationThe fields can simply be selected in the metadata form. However, the field filter applies forall forms if the field template for the selected field is also used in other metadata forms.Restrict the search to a metadata form using a form</s> 
<s>filter.The field filter is compatible with search rule and pattern methods or complete values. This is afield template configuration.The Disable tokenization option (see Tokenization section) for a field template disables the searchrules and patterns for this field. The exact values in the metadata appear in the filter list. For thisfield, the search also works with exact values. In this case, partial terms are not taken into account.16 Configuration and administrationWhen search rules and patterns are enabled, the filter list only contains individual words â€“ both theoriginal words as well as their root forms. The search options in this filter correspond to those ofthe search input field.You can also hide specific filters via the context menu.Numeric fields In the case of fields that are configured as numeric data, the filter list shows the value ranges assearch suggestions.17 Configuration and administrationYou can also enter ranges to the filter with three periods as separators, with 100...900corresponding to a search from 100 to 900. You can also search using less thanâ€¦ (<) and greaterthanâ€¦() e.g. >2500. When you enter text and press the ENTER key, the filter input field turns red ifyour input is invalid.Feed The filter for the search in the feed allows you to search all feed content. This includes both postsand comments created manually as well as posts generated automatically, such as those relatedto a new document version. The feed also contains the version numbers and version comments forboth the current working version of a document and older versions.The feed filter list shows the most popular hashtags as search suggestions. As with all otherentries, these are searched based on the standard linguistic rules in the feed text content.18 Configuration and administrationFile size The document file size filter is the only filter without an input field. You can conveniently select asize range from the available list.Search in the current folder The Current folder only search option is located on the ribbon and narrows the ELO iSearch down tothe most recently used folder. The tooltip shows the current folder.19 Configuration and administrationSince this setting re-filters the results from the search index, it also slows down the searchsignificantly. You should only use this setting if you have applied other search criteria and arecertain there will be a relatively small amount of results. Search filters are ideal for this purpose.Save search In ELO iSearch, you can save your search entries. Use the Save search function (Ribbon > Search).This saves the entire ELO iSearch entry, including the selected filters and filter values. The Currentfolder only setting (on the ribbon) is not saved, as this has an effect on search performance andshould therefore only be used in exceptional cases.For example, you can create a search favorite for a search for current e-mails. Then, all you have todo is enter your search term. The metadata form and time range will be set automatically.20 Configuration and administrationWhen saving the search, you have two options: to create a new search favorite or to change thedefault filter.Default filters You can customize</s> 
<s>the default filters described in the Filters chapter to meet your requirementswith the Save search function. Your personal settings are applied when you start the client and canbe reset at any time by selecting the Restore default settings button.If you make a change to a search filter you are using, you first restore the saved search filter. In thiscase, select Restore default settings again to restore the default filters.Search favorites Search favorites make it easy to perform different recurring searches. Favorites can be displayedon the ribbon. After a restart, they will also appear as tiles in your My ELO workspace in the ELO21 Configuration and administrationJava Client and ELO Web Client. When creating a search favorite, you are requested to assign it aunique name.If you are using a search favorite and then save your search, the dialog box gives you the option tochange your current search favorite:Managing search filters The administrator can define global search filters for other ELO accounts. At the top of the Managefavorites dialog box, you can choose a user whose favorites you want to manage.22 Configuration and administrationYou can rename or delete search favorites, or show them on the ribbon for users or option groups.Select Transfer selected settings to other users to assign search favorites you have selected toother users, option groups, and globally. The default filter settings are shown in the dialog box ifsaved for the selected user.Results list The result of your search is shown in a table (results list) with entries matching your search query.Entries are sorted in descending order by their filing date, i.e. the newest documents are shown atthe top of the results list. You can change how the results list is sorted at any time based on yourneeds and the values and information relevant to the search result.23 Configuration and administrationInformationWhen displaying the matches found in the document in the table view (see correspondingcolumn), all parts of the document matching the search entry are displayed, even if aspecific match was excluded from the search area (see Search area/fields searched section).The document in question was only found via the specified search area, but it can be helpfulto know of other text matches occurring in the document.Number of results and pages To speed up the search, a parameter is available that limits the maximum number of results to beshown. This parameter is configured on the server and can be adjusted based on the requirements.The relevant permissions are required for this.If this number/parameter value is exceeded, older documents are not shown in the search result.By using a date filter, you can access these documents specifically or exclude them from thesearch.24 Configuration and administrationThe ELO Java Client shows the results divided into individual results pages. This is necessary sincethe results are prepared linearly based on the number of hits. Use the left and right arrows tonavigate between pages.Please noteThe total number shown here is only an estimate. Permissions in ELO may change overtime, such as when new documents are filed to ELO. For this</s> 
<s>reason, the Indexserver filtersall entries again, meaning fewer or more results may be shown. The client adjusts the valuedisplayed as soon as the search is completed and the entries have been filtered again. Thesame happens when searching in the current folder. These values may differ significantlysince the estimate always refers to the entire repository.List, tile, and tree views Besides the table view, the ELO Java Client also offers a list, tile, or tree view to display the searchresults. You will find the display options on the grey toolbar.The list view is especially compact, making it ideal for providing a clear overview of the number ofresults and leaving a great amount of space to preview documents on the user's screen.25 Configuration and administrationThe tile view is especially suitable for thumbnails. Please remember that these are generated bythe client, so all documents have to be downloaded from the server first. This view is suitable formanageable amounts of results on a local network.26 Configuration and administrationThe tree view allows you to arrange the results in a tree structure based on different criteria. Oneoption is to display the result according to the structure in ELO. You can also define your ownstructures using the fields of the entries. For the Invoice metadata form, for example, a structure byyear and company name would be possible as long as the metadata form contained the requiredvalues as fields.27 Configuration and administrationDashboards In the Search work area, buttons are available that allow you to launch dashboards after conductinga search with a form filter. These buttons are only displayed if dashboards have been stored for thecorresponding metadata form.28 Configuration and administrationYou can store the dashboards in the ELO Administration Console.The dashboards allow you to visualize metadata of entries filed with the same metadata form indifferent ways. You can use bar charts, line charts, and doughnut charts.29 Configuration and administrationIf you select a dashboard button, a new dialog box opens. You can move the mouse over thedashboards to view details about them.For information on how to create dashboards, refer to the ELO packages documentation, Metadata> Metadata forms > Configure metadata forms > Create dashboards.30 Configuration and administrationTechnical description Architecture Elasticsearch Elasticsearch is a distributed, highly scalable open source search engine based on Apache Lucenethat allows users to save large data volumes and perform extremely fast searches. Communicationtakes place via a RESTful web interface.There is a great amount of reference material available online, including basic documentation andmethods. This documentation only addresses the details relevant for use in the ELO systemenvironment. For more information, we recommend the following starting point for furtherresearch: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html.Lucene Elasticsearch uses Apache Lucene as its core library. With Elasticsearch, each index can be dividedinto several parts (referred to as shards). One shard corresponds to one Lucene index, whichconsists of one folder containing the associated index files.The shards can be distributed to multiple servers (nodes). You can also create replicas. These forma cluster.31 Configuration and administrationhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.htmlhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.htmlLanguage support The Elasticsearch uses its own language analyzer during indexing and the search process.</s> 
<s>Thisoptimizes language-specific search rules and patterns. For ELO specifically, please note that therepository language (selected during installation) has a major influence on the search.The following languages are supported:German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Danish, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, Czech,Hungarian, Romanian, Turkish, Bulgarian, Finnish, Greek, Norwegian, and Russian.Processing with ELO The following flowchart illustrates processing with ELO:The ELO Indexserver transfers the data to Elasticsearch, which uses its own language analyzerduring indexing and the search process. The index data is saved in Lucene indices.Searching indexes requires access to:The index filesA consistence Lucene databaseA functional Elasticsearch language analyzerA running ELO Indexserver (ELOix).Security Since ELO ECM Suite 10.2, communication between the ELO Indexserver (ELOix) and Elasticsearchis encrypted (SSL). The Search Guard plug-in is used for this.Installation and upgrade ELO Server Setup Installations or upgrades are done in the ELO Server Setup, which generates the configuration if itdoesn't exist and installs the Elasticsearch program and the service, as well as a data directorywhere the index files are saved. The following options are available in the ELO Server Setup:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 32 Configuration and administrationName of serviceMemory valuePortData directoryWith ELOenterprise, additional Elasticsearch servers (see also License terms whendistributing server processes).Please noteAs of ELO 21.2, the ELO iSearch port (default: 9200) is secured with TLS/SSL.You may get a certificate warning the first time you open it in a browser.Depending on the browser and operating system, you must import the certificate into thecertificate store of the browser or operating system. For example, if you are using MicrosoftEdge or Google Chrome on Microsoft Windows, load the keystore.jks file from <ELO>\config\elastic\<ELO iSearch server>\certificates into the Windows certificatestore. If you are using Mozilla Firefox, add the certificate to the Firefox certificate store byignoring the certificate warning message.Checks after installation After installation, you can call https://<server>:<port> (default port: 9200) with an administrativeTomcat account to perform some checks. If you use any browser, a JSON file is output, which youcan open in an editor.This allows you to view important basic data such as the version and name.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 33 Configuration and administrationYou can perform additional checks in the ELO iSearch configuration. You can reach the configurationvia the Indexserver configuration page or the following link (log on with an administrative Tomcataccount):https://<server>:<ixport>ix-<REPOSITORY>/manager/esconfig/#/iSearchConfigReindexing the full text database after an upgrade from older ELO versions Updating from an earlier ELO version (up to 21.01) to version 21.02 or 21.03 requires you to reindexthe index data. The ELO Server Setup removes the previous Elasticsearch indexes as they are nolonger compatible with the current Elasticsearch version.During reindexing, first the existing index is deleted and then rebuilt. All fields are saved in both tokenized and not tokenized (as a phrase) forms meaning changes to this field setting do notrequire a reindex. In addition, the full text content is read out from the FT*.txt files generated in theELO full text process and used for indexing.You can initiate a reindex on the Indexer tab of the ELO iSearch configuration.34 Configuration and administrationThe progress is shown after you refresh the</s> 
<s>page.Background reindex of the full text database For upgrades from ELO version 9.3 and higher, the ELO Server Setup Upgrade Index function installsan isolated ELO Indexserver that builds the Elasticsearch index in the background. This makessense for large systems in particular, as reindexing can take several days. You can use this functionwhen updating to a more current ELO version or when making changes to the iSearch settings.35 Configuration and administrationYou can import this index when upgrading ELO so that the full scope of search functions is availableimmediately after the upgrade.Refer to the Background reindex of the full text database section for details of this process.Sizing and performance A performant search is crucial for users to accept the ELO system. For this reason, the Elasticsearchmust be optimized regularly (e.g. every six months, depending on the additional document anddata volume) along with database performance. You should check whether this is necessary at theuser level (by performing complex searches) but also at the server level (by occasionally analyzingthe log file, see the section Log file).General information on sizing Elasticsearch performance depends on the following factors:RAM both for the Elasticsearch JVM (Java virtual machine) and the operating system ingeneralNumber of processors/coresMemory technology/memory access timesThe following general statements on dimensioning apply:RAM: For small environments, the standard 4 GB suffice.You should allow approx. 20 GB for medium-sized environments (approx. 10 milliondocuments).As there is a limit of 31 GB per JVM for large environments, server clustering isrecommended.Processors/cores: Each search requires a thread, i.e. a higher number of processors/cores achievesimproved parallelization.Hard drives: Fast hard drives (SSD) significantly increase performance. Search performanceespecially benefits from fast memory access when loading index data.Even for medium-sized environments, we recommend using ELOenterprise (see also License termswhen distributing server processes).Please noteâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ â—¦ â€¢ â—¦ 36 Configuration and administrationWhen configuring metadata forms, the number of forms used should not reach double-digits.A separate search index is built for each metadata form. A large number of metadata formstherefore requires a large amount of RAM and hard disk space for the ELO iSearch.This applies for first generation and second generation metadata forms.Optimizing the indexing process You can only optimize the indexing process to a certain extent. The number of documents indexedat the same time is determined by the ELO Indexserver (ELOix). Should you have to reindex largevolumes of documents, we recommend providing a separate Indexserver for this task (see also Background reindex of the full text database).Optimizing search performance Performance factors were already covered in the section General information on sizing. In largeenvironments, increasing the number of shards per index can have a positive effect on the searchspeed if they are distributed to multiple nodes. Please note that changing the number of shardsrequires reindexing of the full text index. Refer to the section Setting the number of shards perindex for more information on configuring the number of shards.System sizing examples The following table contains the sizing of various customer environments as an example. In all ofthese customer environments, Elasticsearch is implemented</s>

ForELO 11 and ELO 12, you can search for the term queryTerm in the log file, for example. The followingexample shows the output of a full text search for the term test:Evaluations You can query various Elasticsearch statuses via the browser. You can then use these for monitoringsolutions (e.g. Nagios) if desired. You require an administrative Tomcat account to log on. A queryoutputs a JSON file like the one shown in the following screenshot, which you can show in MozillaFirefox.The URL for the health check is: https://<server>:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true22:51:34,723 eloix-find-40 eloix-find-40 INFO (ElasticClient.java:183) - find(searchId=[(09A4500F-6BC6-4ECF38 Configuration and administrationThe status yellow means that the index is functional but the replica shards are not all available. Ina single server environment using (1) as the default setting for replicas, the yellow status isnormal.The URL for the index directory name is: https://<server>:<port>/_cat/indicesOne index exists for each metadata form, and can be recognized based on its ID.39 Configuration and administrationThe URL for statistical data is: https://\<server\>:9200/_stats.This allows you to check whether a new document has been added to the index. After a newdocument has been added, the value in the first line of the query after count is increased by 1.Additional queries are possible in the same fashion. These are described in the Elasticsearch onlinedocumentation.Backup options and strategies The iSearch data can be restored fully from the database via the Indexserver. The decision whetherto create a backup of the Elasticsearch index depends on the following factors:How much downtime is acceptable for users?Keeping downtime to a minimum requires a backup strategy that allows a backed up iSearch indexto quickly be imported to a live system.How long will it take to restore the iSearch index?The duration of the initial reindex can be used as an indicator of how long subsequent reindexeswill take. You have to decide whether this downtime period is within reason for users.â€¢ â€¢ 40 Configuration and administrationThere are two options for creating a backup. For both solutions, the indices between the differentIndexserver versions may not necessarily be compatible. After importing the backup, you will haveto reindex the documents changed since the backup was created. This can be</s> 
<s>done using theUpdater.The value for Process documents newer than is set to the time the backup was created. It makessense to create a backup once a day or week to keep the process for indexing changed documentsto a minimum.Please note that the index named searchguard is necessary to ensure SSL encryption by means ofthe Search Guard plug-in. If this index does not exist, you the Indexserver will not be able toconnect to Elasticsearch. If you have accidentally deleted the searchguard index, you can restore itby running the server setup again. The searchguard index also depends on the selectedadministrative Tomcat account, meaning you cannot just copy the index if the account orpasswords differ, and the index must be created by the server setup.41 Configuration and administrationCopying an existing index You can copy the existing index from the file system and re-import it at a later point in time. Copythe entire folder located at <installation directory>/data/<â€¦><server name>/index as a backup. Ifthe backup is required, replace the content of the folder named above with the backup.Before copying, you should stop the iSearch service to prevent access errors.Creating snapshots with Elasticsearch Elasticsearch offers the option to create snapshots of existing indexes. If snapshots are generatedregularly, a complete copy is not created every time. Instead, only the changed files are saved toreduce the amount of memory required.You will find a guide here:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/snapshot-restore.htmlPlease noteTo recover a snapshot, the following line has to be inserted in the Elasticsearch configurationfile (<installation directory>/config/elastic/<server name>/elasticsearch.yml): searchguard.enable_snapshot_restore_privilege: trueTips and tricks ELO iSearch configuration You can open the ELO iSearch Configuration page, available starting with ELO 11, via theIndexserver configuration page or at the following link:https://<server>:<Port>:/ix-<Repository>/manager/esconfig/#/isearchConfig42 Configuration and administrationhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/snapshot-restore.htmlhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/snapshot-restore.htmlThe above figure shows the ELO iSearch configuration. In the ELO iSearch configuration, you canaccess the different functions of the iSearch (1); the active tab is underlined in blue (2). At the topright (3) you will see the name of the ELOix instance calling the ELO iSearch configuration, with theconnection status to ELO iSearch (4) either connected or disconnected.Since ELO 11, the settings for ELO iSearch are saved in the eloixopt table specific to the instance orfor all instances (_ALL), as with the Indexserver options. In the table, all the ELO iSearch settingshave the prefix esearch. In the ELO iSearch configuration, you can view and edit the settings for allinstances (_ALL) or specific instances (5).Updater The above figure shows an overview of the Updater. This is required to regularly update ELOiSearch. It also ensures new and changed objects are sent to ELO iSearch. In the top line (1), youwill see when the Updater is scheduled to start again, and the next line (2) indicates from whichdate on documents are processed. You can set both values. In the default configuration, the Updaterruns every minute (5) and processes a maximum of 1000 objects (3) in the smallest time unit (1minute). Please note that the number of selected objects is cached in the ELOix memory, so youshould only change this value with caution.If there are issues indexing</s> 
<s>a document, a reference to the document is created at the followingpath in ELO:Administration//Fulltext Configuration//Update ErrorsThis allows you to easily monitor errors and make sure that documents are sent to ELO iSearchagain, for example by opening the Metadata dialog box. You can set the maximum number ofdocuments in this folder in (4). If you set 0, no references will be created.Save any changes with the Save button (9).Updater status of all IX (10) provides an overview of all running update processes. You can alsomanually start the update process by clicking Update (6) or pause by selecting Break (7). Note thatstarting and stopping always applies to the current ELOix instance.The most recent error in the update process is shown in Last Error (8).43 Configuration and administrationIndexer The Indexer (image above) initially provides ELO iSearch with objects from ELO. All existing objectsare sent to ELO iSearch, beginning with objects with the highest ID, indexed in descending order. Asa result, new objects can be found first, provided the index is used in the productive environmentright away.The top line (1) indicates the start time of the last reindex process. In (2) and (3), you can choosethe object IDs to be indexed. If you would like to perform a complete reindex, set both values to -1.The existing index is deleted as a result. If you would like to add only specific objects to an existingindex, you can do this by means of IDs.The settings for the objects per index interval (3) and references in ELO (4) correspond to those ofthe Updater. The references are filed to the folder at the following path:Administration//Fulltext Configuration//Reindex ErrorsThis value is the same for both the Updater and the Indexer.The Continue Reindex on Failure setting (5) indicates whether to cancel or continue reindexing incase of an error. If you would like to continue, you should regularly check the log outputs.The most recent error in the reindex process is shown in Last Error (8).Select Save (9) to save the settings.You can start a reindex (if both object IDs are set to -1), or continue (6) or cancel it (7). As with theUpdater, remember that this always applies to the ELOix instance the configuration page wascalled with.(10) provides an overview of all active reindex processes.44 Configuration and administrationSettings The above image contains an overview of additional setting options for ELO iSearch. In IX instance(1), select whether the settings should be applied to all instances or to a specific instance (see alsothe next figure ELO iSearch configuration, â€˜Setting' tab, instance-specific settings).Details on the connection between ELOix and Elasticsearch are specified in (2), (3), and (4). Thename of the Elasticsearch index (5) corresponds to the name of the repository in lower case lettersby default.You can also specify whether an ELOix should be used to send objects to ELO iSearch at all (6). Ifthis setting is enabled, the full text search via ELO iSearch is still enabled.The number of shards and shards per form is set under (7) and (8). Th chapter Setting the numberof</s> 
<s>shards per index describes these settings in more detail.The Analyzer settings (9) determine how text sent to Elastic search is processed. Normally, you canuse the default settings.Settings (10) to (14) apply to the search. You can set whether to return suggestions for corrections(10) or synonyms (12) for the search query and whether autocomplete (11) is active. Furthermore,you can enable searches with a wildcard character at the beginning of the term (13). This isdisabled by default, as searches with a leading wildcard can cause high load on the server. You canalso set the maximum search results (14) returned via the findFirstSords() and findNextSords()ELOix API calls.You can edit the ELO iSearch language settings under Language Settings (15). The system orrepository language is set by the server setup and cannot be changed. You can select additionallanguages depending on the available licenses.Select Save (16) to save all settings. Please note that the settings (5), (7), (8), (9), and (15) requirea reindex to apply to all data and not cause inconsistent data in ELO iSearch.45 Configuration and administrationThe figure shows the setting page for the instance ELO-DESKTOP-8LUHTIV (1). All settings wherethe override check box is enabled (3) overwrite the settings applied for all instances.You can only apply the build separate index (2) setting for specific instances. If this setting isenabled, a separate index is built with this Indexserver if either the connection settings or theindex name differs from those of the other instances. This is explained in more detail in the chapterBackground reindex of the full text database.Elasticsearch service configuration The Elasticsearch service is configured via multiple files and directories.In detail, the files and directories contain the following:â€¢ 46 Configuration and administrationelasticsearch.yml: Central configuration file for Elasticsearch. Refer to the following websitefor more detailed information: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/important-settings.htmllog4j.properties: logging settingssgconfig: directory containing the Search Guard plug-in configurationcertificates: keystore and truststore for SSL communication with ELO IndexserverSSL communication Starting with ELO ECM Suite 10.2, communication between ELO Indexserver instances andElasticsearch is encrypted. The ELO Server Setup creates self-signed certificates as well ascorresponding keystores and truststores during installation. The keystore and truststore are createdwithin the respective config directories (Indexserver and Elasticsearch) and can be opened with thestandard Java tools (e.g. keytool.exe) to check the certificates. Enter the password for theadministrative Tomcat account.Indexserver plug-ins Since ELO 11, ELO Indexserver can be extended using OSGi plug-ins. For example, the Elasticsearchinterface is located in this type of plug-in. In the future, this distribution will enable access to anewer Elasticsearch index with an older version of the ELO Indexserver. One plug-in directory isconfigured for each Indexserver.Setting the number of shards per index Starting with ELO 11, one index is created per metadata form. By default, each index consists ofone shard. Creating one index per metadata form alone boosts cluster performance, as the indicesare distributed to several nodes.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 47 Configuration and administrationhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/important-settings.htmlhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/important-settings.htmlhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/important-settings.htmlIt also makes sense to split large indices into several shards. The advantage of this is that searchqueries are run in parallel on all shards. However, the number of search queries</s> 
<s>run in parallelwithin a node does not exceed the number of available processors.As a result, the number of shards is based on the data contained. Elasticsearch recommendskeeping the shard size between 20GB and 40GB. Too small of shards results in excessivecommunication between the shards, as the data has to be synchronized between them. Metadataforms containing an excessive amount of sords with full text should be split into multiple shardswhenever possible.The number of shards per metadata form can be set on the ELO iSearch configuration page, butchanging this number requires all data to be reindexed.Setting the number of replicas per index Replicas are like copies of an index. You can choose any value, including 0. One primary shard iscreated for each shard, as well as the specified number of replica shards in the cluster. Primaryshards and replica shards are always created on different nodes to be able to continue providingdata in case of a failure. If a node fails, the primary shards that were previously allocated to thisnode are allocated to a different node. The replica shards are distributed to other nodes to ensurethe best possible system reliability and performance.Another advantage of replica shards is parallel search queries: Elasticsearch distributes searchqueries to different primary shards and replica shards in order to balance the load of the searchqueries.The health status of an index depends on what shard are available: If the primary shard isavailable, the status is yellow. If all replica shards are also available, the status is green.The number of replica shards should be adjusted to the number of nodes in the cluster so that theshards can be distributed to several nodes in order to ensure system reliability. On the other hand,each replica requires just as much memory as the primary shard.The default setting for the number of replicas is 1. In a cluster of more than one instance, eachshard is replicated once, meaning it exists twice in total. Changing the number of replicas does notrequire reindexing.To speed up reindexing in a cluster, you can set the number of replicas to 0 for the duration ofreindexing and then increase it once reindexing is complete. If the number of replicas > 0, the datain both the primary shard and each replica shard is indexed at the same time. This means thatanalysis and conversion to Elasticsearch data takes place several times in parallel. If the number ofreplicas is set to 0, the data is only processed in one node during reindexing. Once the number ofreplicas is increased, the indexed primary shards are copied to the other nodes, which is generallymuch faster. Of course, system reliability cannot be guaranteed during reindexing.The setting applies to an index and can be changed to 2 as in the following metadata form with ID 42 in the repository repository, for example with the curl tool (https://curl.haxx.se/):48 Configuration and administrationhttps://curl.haxx.se/https://curl.haxx.se/If you'd like to change the setting for all indices, do not specify an index and use the URL the localhost:9200/_settings.Tokenization The Disable tokenization option for a field template disables</s> 
<s>the search rules and patterns for thisfield. The exact values in the metadata appear in the filter list. For this field, the search also workswith exact values. In this case, partial terms are not taken into account.When search rules and patterns are enabled, the filter list only contains individual words â€“ both theoriginal words as well as their root forms. The search options in this filter correspond to those ofthe search input field.Integrating custom thesauruses You can customize the thesauruses that ELO iSearch uses for a repository. The necessary files arelocated at the following path in ELO:Administration//Fulltext Configuration//ThesaurusThis path contains a country-coded child directory containing three documents for each language.curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/repositoryÂ¶42/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' "index" : { "number_of_replicas" : 249 Configuration and administration<Language>_thesaurus: The thesaurus supplied by ELO for this language. You shouldn't changethis file so that it can be replaced with a newer version when performing an update.<\Language>_add: In this document, you can enter terms to be added to the thesaurus assynonyms.<Language>_stop: With this document, you can exclude specific terms from the thesaurus that donot fit your application.Please noteAfter these documents are changed, the ELO Indexserver has to be restarted so that thethesaurus can be rebuilt based on the changed files.Cluster operation You can read about how to run ELO in a cluster in the documentation on ELO iSearch under ELOserver â€“ Installation and operation.Power search The ELO iSearch power search enables users to send complex search queries to ELO iSearch anduse the iSearch syntax.The power search function in ELO iSearch allows you to access the underlying Elasticsearchdatabase. As a result, users can directly access fields that they cannot select using a filter as wellas use the Elasticsearch syntax to run complex search queries.50 Configuration and administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/ops/onprem/en-us/installation/ha/elo-isearch.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/ops/onprem/en-us/installation/ha/elo-isearch.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/ops/onprem/en-us/installation/ha/elo-isearch.htmlThe ability to access internal structures is also the downside of the power search given that thesyntax is highly technical and requires knowledge of the internal data structures. It should also benoted that these internal structures can change in future versions of ELO, meaning that existingsearch requests may no longer work or no longer work properly.ImportantInformation: You should only use the power search in exceptions, i.e. if a normal searchquery will not achieve the desired result, such as with certain administrative requests.Using the power search You can use the power search in the ELO Java Client as well as in the ELO Web Client. Starting withan equal character (=), enter the search query in the field provided as shown in the example below.The power search sends requests straight to the Elasticsearch via the ELO Indexserver. The ELOIndexserver carries out an authorization check to ensure that you only see the documents that youhave permissions to even when running the power search.The power search syntax corresponds to the syntax QueryStringQuery, as documented byElasticsearch:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntaxIt is especially important that you are able to escape special characters. This is necessary if theuser wants the character to be interpreted as a normal letter in order to ignore any special meaningin the context in which they are</s> 
<s>being used, which would affect the search. The followingcharacters have a special meaning in the syntax QueryStringQuery and must therefore be escapedif this meaning is to be ignored:Characters Meaning+<word> <word> must occur in the document-<word><word> must not occur in the document (unless a spaceprecedes it)<word1> && <word2> The document must contain both words<word1> and <word2> separated bytwo pipe symbolsThe document must contain at least one of the twowords> x < x Greater/less than (works for numbers or words)51 Configuration and administrationhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntaxhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntaxhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntaxCharacters Meaning>= x <= xGreater than or equal to/less than or equal to (works fornumbers as well as words)Has no significance on its own, at the beginning of theline: power search{x TO y} Range search (without x and y)[x TO y] Range search (including x and y)<word>^ Significance of word"<word> <word>" Phrase search<word>~ Fuzziness (fuzzy search)* Wildcard, any number of characters?

It is thereforepossible that a search query will work with one version, but not with the next.Examples of requests It often makes sense to find out whether a document can be found using the iSearch.

These language analyzers perform four primary functions: they divide the text into singlewords, convert the tokens into lowercase letters, remove common stop words, andderive the root forms of the tokens.SearchindexElasticsearch stores all data in a search index. This index is then split into types anddocuments with properties.SWAPmode/swappingIn IT, swapping within the storage hierarchy refers to moving data from a higher to alower level or vice versa. Swapping is intended to combine the advantages of higherlevels, that is higher speed, and lower levels, that is higher capacity and lessexpensive memory.(Source:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapping, last updatedMarch 29, 2022)TokenWhen creating or updating a data set, the Elasticsearch breaks down the searchabletext in the data set into individual terms, referred to as tokens. The tokens are thenstored in the search index. A search query is also broken down into tokens. These arethen searched for in the search index. A token does not always correspond to agrammatically correct word. Instead, it is a breakdown and simplification of wordsmeaning that searching for car also finds documents containing only the word cars.TomcatApache Tomcat is an open source web server and web container that implements thespecifications for Java servlets and Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), allowing webapplications written in Java to be run as servlets or on a JSP basis.YMLYML is the file extension</s>

In the case of metadata, textfields are analyzed and the contents of each field are stored unchanged (e.g. as keyword, date,etc.).This makes it easier for users to find the information that is relevant for their specific use case.They can simultaneously search the full text and feed contents as well as the metadata.Steps before indexing The metadata of documents in the ELO repository are available in the SQL database and can beimmediately accessed by the Indexserver. The full text information, on the other hand, first needsto be extracted from a document. This task is performed by the ELO Textreader module.The Textreader fetches the document from the Indexserver, extract its full text contents and sendsthis back to the Indexserver, which stores it as a separate file in the ELO repository. The Textreaderalso uses OCR software to extract text contents if required (e.g. in image files).Regular indexing process The indexing process is performed by the Indexserver. The Indexserver checks at regular intervals(updater interval can be configured in the ELO iSearch configuration) which documents have beenadded, modified, or deleted since the last indexing run. These need to be updated in the iSearchindexes.The Indexserver retrieves the metadata and feed information of the documents from the SQLdatabase. Full text contents (if available) are retrieved from the repository with the ELO Textreader.Once processed, the information is forwarded to the iSearch, i.e. the Elasticsearch instance, whichthen indexes the field contents. In the process, the full text and feed content is analyzed inaccordance with the language as described above.Please noteYou should consider carefully which documents to add to the iSearch database. Adding toomuch text information will reduce search engine performance. It can make sense to excludecertain types of documents (e.g. entire book, brochures, etc.)58 Configuration and administrationhttps://docs.elo.com/ops/textreader2/en-us/textreader-2/https://docs.elo.com/ops/textreader2/en-us/textreader-2/Background reindexIntroduction This document describes the Upgrade Index function in the ELO Server Setup, as well as itsapplication.Please noteThe Upgrade index function in the ELO Server Setup must not be performed on theproduction database in ELO 12 or higher, as changes to the database during the installationprocess will cause issues in older versions of ELO.If you still want to use the function, you must duplicate the data of the production databasein a separate database instance.

Each replication set stands for one repository. The replication setis a characteristic that you assign to individual repositories in order to replicate them in anotherrepository. The individual entries to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO WebClient using the Assign replication sets function.8 Configuration and administrationYou will find the Assign replication sets functions in Ribbon > Organize > Properties.Please noteYou should log which entries you assign which replication sets.Please noteReplication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure. To preventinheritance, select the Start point for replication option in the Metadata dialog box of theentry you want to replicate. In the ELO Java Client, this function is only available for folders.You will find more information in the chapter Replication set inheritance.Result Once you have performed the steps above, the entries are replicated according to your settings inthe configuration.9 Configuration and administrationBasics In the following chapter, you will learn how data synchronization and data transfer work.Functionality ELO Replication compares entries between multiple repositories. The relevant repositories can beinstalled at different locations. ELO Replication transfers the data to the relevant repositories. Thismeans the repositories do not necessarily have to be available to one another.ELO Replication is a web app based on Java that is installed on an Apache Tomcat.Replication set The replication set is a characteristic that you assign to individual repositories in order to replicatethem in another repository. Create locations and add repositories in the web-based configuration.Using the ELO Indexserver URL, specify which repositories data is replicated from. A replication setis created automatically in the configuration when you add a new repository. Each replication setstands for one repository. The individual entries (folders, documents) to be replicated are selectedin the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client using the "Assign replication sets" function. With thisfunction, you select the repository you want to export the entries to. This means you select arepository the entries are replicated to.Data synchronization ELO Replication captures, distributes, and transfers changes to the relevant repositories. Anextension to the ELO Indexserver creates a synchronization data set with the changes to arepository. The format of this data set is a compressed stream of JSON objects from the ELOIndexserver API. The data in this stream is selected in the ELO Indexserver based on itssynchronization status. The following options are available:Entries without a replication set: Entries that you do not want to synchronize are not assigned areplication set. A replication set determines which other repositories the entry is synchronized with.Entries without a replication set are not added to</s> 
<s>the synchronization data set.Entries with a new replication set: Entries that you want to synchronize are assigned newreplication sets. The information from the entries is added to the synchronization data set. All theentry information is only sent to the repositories assigned the new replication set. If entries havealready been assigned replication sets, their repositories are simply informed that the entries arenow replicated with additional repositories.The ELO Indexserver assigns replicated entries the tstampsync field when creating thesynchronization data set in the database. The tstampsync field contains the value from thecorresponding tstamp field at the time the data was read from the database. In the synchronizationdata set, the tstampsync contains the value it had when the database was read. This differenceplays an important role when importing the data set.10 Configuration and administrationInformationThe name of the tstampsync field varies depending on the table.Entries changed since the last synchronization: The entries were changed since the lastsynchronization. To recognize a change, the tstamp and tstampsync fields are compared. In case ofchanges, the ELO Indexserver automatically sets the tstamp field to the current time in UTC(Coordinated Universal Time).Entries unchanged since the last synchronization: The entries were not changed since the lastsynchronization. For unchanged entries, the values in the tstamp and tstampsync fields areidentical. Unchanged entries are not added to the synchronization data set.Data transfer The synchronization data set is created by the ELO Indexserver. ELO Replication initiates itscreation based on a configured schedule. The synchronization data set is streamed by the ELOReplication to the other locations, and from there it is streamed to the ELO Replication of the otherrepositories so it can be imported. During streaming, the data set is processed between the ELOReplication instances. Only the data required is sent at the target is sent.To compensate for instabilities during transmission, ELO Replication caches the data sets. Ifdisconnected, ELO Replication re-attempts to send the data set once a minute. The data set istransferred all over again, regardless of when the previous transfer was interrupted.The SSHD library from the Apache MINA project is used for data transfer. The method with publicand private keys is used exclusively for authentication. The keys are automatically generated foreach location when configuring ELO Replication.InformationYou can add additional options for transferring data by creating and integrating plug-ins.The ELO Indexserver imports the synchronization data set into the target repository. The followingoptions are available:Entry does not exist in repository: The GUID is used to check whether an entry already exists in therepository. If the entry does not exist in the repository, it is imported.Entry already exists in the repository and has not changed since the last synchronization: Thevalues in the tstampsync fields of the synchronization data set and repository entries are identical.The entry is imported into the repository. The entry in the repository is overwritten with the valuesfrom the synchronization data set.Entry already exists in the repository and has competing changes: The values in the tstamp fieldsof the synchronization data set and repository entries do not match. If an entry has been changedin multiple repositories,</s> 
<s>the latest change is applied. If the latest change comes from the target11 Configuration and administrationrepository, the entry in the synchronization data set is ignored. Otherwise, the values of the entryin the repository would be replaced with the values in the synchronization data set.In rare cases, the values in the tstampsync fields may differ. This occurs when a synchronizationdata set is created in the local repository before the synchronization data set of the otherrepository has been read and the entry is changed in both repositories. The latest change is appliedin this case as well.What data is replicated? The following data is synchronized during replication:FoldersDocumentsSticky notesRelationsWorkflowsWorkflow templatesMap dataFeedMaster data: users and groups (via owners and ACLs), metadata forms, aspects, colors,replication setsMaster data is resolved recursively. For example, if a user is listed in the ACL of a folder, this user'sgroups are also included in the synchronization data set.How is master data replicated? During data export, the ELO Indexserver checks which master data belongs to a SORD.Only users that a SORD explicitly refers to are replicated. If you want to replicate a specific user,this user has to be referenced by a SORD, e.g. via permissions (Metadata > Permissions) or Ownerrights (Create folder, File document, Apply stamp/annotation, Start workflow).Please noteIf a user is replicated, the groups the user belongs to are also replicated (without theindividual members).If a group is replicated, for example because it has permission to a SORD, the individualgroup members are not replicated.If a metadata form is replicated, a time stamp is set in the masktstampsync field of the docmaskstable in the database. Metadata forms that have already been replicated are added to thesynchronization data set if changes have been made to the forms.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 12 Configuration and administrationHow are workflows replicated? The following section describes the behavior starting with ELO Indexserver version 21.03.With the default settings, a workflow can only run in one repository. During data export, theworkflow is assigned a flag indicating which repository it is running in. In the target repository, theworkflow is displayed after replication but it will not continue. You cannot start, edit, or delete theworkflow in the target repository.To use the workflow in the target repository as well, the flag needs to be changed during export.This is done with a server transfer node, which is added in the workflow designer. If a servertransfer node is set, the workflows stops at this node. Once the data has been transferred throughreplication, the workflow continues in the target repository. The entire workflow including allsubworkflows is always replicated.Please noteThe server transfer can only take place in a main workflow, not in a subworkflow. If you wantto start a subworkflow at location B, the server transfer must take place in the mainworkflow at location A. If a group is replicated, for example because it has permission to aSORD, the individual group members are not replicated.A subworkflow should only run at one location. You should not start a subworkflow atlocation A and continue it</s> 
<s>at location B, as conflicts that cannot be resolved automaticallycan occur if the main workflow and subworkflow are running in different repositories at thesame time.13 Configuration and administrationInstallation This chapter explains how to install ELO Replication.Requirements The following requirement must be met for installation:All servers hosting repositories involved in replication must be in sync in terms of time for thecomparison via timestamp to work.Please noteThe same version of ELO Replication and the ELO Indexserver should be installed at alllocations.Step by step AttentionReplication sets and their assignments in the repository that were created in a version olderthan ELO Replication 12 will be deleted when migrating to ELO Replication 21.

For more detailed information, refer to the chapters Assign replication sets and Replicationset inheritance.Replication set inheritance Replication sets are automatically created in the configuration when you add a new repository. Eachreplication set stands for one repository. The replication set is a characteristic that you assign toindividual repositories in order to replicate them in another repository. The individual entries(folders, documents) to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client usingthe Assign replication sets function.Information31 Configuration and administrationYou only have to assign replication sets at one location. The assigned replication sets arealso configured at the other locations through replication.Default: Inheritance to parent folder Replication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure.Example: If you assign the folder C including its child entries a replication set, the entries markedin yellow are replicated. The replication set is inherited to the parent folders.'Start point for replication' option To prevent the replication sets from being inherited to the parent folders, select the Start point forreplication option in the Metadata dialog box of the entry you want to replicate. The Start point forreplication option allows you to replicate parts of repositories that are not filed to identicalrepository structures.Please noteIn the ELO Java Client, this function is only available for folders.Please note32 Configuration and administrationEnable the Start point for replication option before assigning the entry a replication set.Example: You have enabled the Start point for replication option for the C folder. If you then assignthe C folder including its child entries a replicated sets, only the folder C and its child entries arereplicated (marked yellow). The replication set is not inherited to the parent folders.33 Configuration and administrationDuring the</s> 
<s>next replication process, the C folder is filed to the following path in the targetrepository: // Administration // Replication Base. From there, the administrator moves the folder tothe desired location in the target repository. This only has to be performed during the initialreplication process. The replication remembers the repository structure.Assign replication sets Information Replication sets are automatically created in the configuration when you add a new repository. Eachreplication set stands for one repository. The replication set is a characteristic that you assign toindividual repositories in order to replicate them in another repository. The individual entries(folders, documents) to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client usingthe Assign replication sets function. This means you select a repository the entries are replicatedto. The name of a replication set in the ELO client is made up of the location name and the name ofthe repository.InformationThe following uses screenshots of the ELO Java Client.Information34 Configuration and administrationYou only have to assign replication sets at one location. The assigned replication sets areconfigured at the other locations through replication.You will find the Assign replication sets functions in Ribbon > Organize > Properties.Requirements You need the right Assign replication sets.

You do not have to add it manually.Select one or more replication sets and confirm with OK.4. 36 Configuration and administrationThe replication sets appear in the Assign replication sets dialog box.Please noteReplication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure. Toprevent inheritance, select the Start point for replication option in the Metadata dialogbox of the entry you want to replicate. In the ELO Java Client, this function is onlyavailable for folders. You will find more information in the chapter Replication setinheritance.The following options are available:Including child entries: If this option is enabled, the replication set is also assigned to thechild entries of the selected entry.Set: All the listed replication sets are assigned to the entry.Differences: This option should only be used in combination with the Include child entriesoption. Differences: If you removed replication sets from the list and/or added replicationsets to the list, this change is passed on to the entries. Replication sets from the list thatwere not changed are not passed on. The replication sets of the entries that</s>

The Assignreplication sets dialog box opens for the folder. The Include child entries option is enabled.The Blue, Orange, and Pink replication sets are already assigned to the folder. The Greenreplication set is added. The Differences option is selected. The Green replication set isadded to the list again. This change is passed on to the folder and its child folders.Replication sets from the list that were not changed are not passed on. The Blue, Orange, andPink replication sets are not assigned again. This means the child folder is not assigned the Pink replication set. The replication sets of the entries that were not changed are retained.Folders and child folders retain their original replication sets and are additionally assignedthe Green replication set.Cut: The replication sets are assigned to the entry. The replication sets that are not withinthis intersection are removed. This option should only be used in combination with the Include child entries option. Use the Cut option if, for example, it is unclear due to the set Start point for replication which replication sets are assigned to the child entries and you onlywant to inherit the replication sets selected in the dialog box. In contrast to the Set option,with the Cut option you cannot assign any new replication sets. With the Cut function, youcan delete replication sets from child entries that are not contained in the parent entry.38 Configuration and administrationIn the example above, a folder and its child folders have different replication sets. The Assignreplication sets dialog box opens for the folder. The Include child entries option is enabled.The Blue, Orange, Pink, and Yellow replication sets are already assigned to the folder. The Orange replication set is deleted. The Cut option is selected. The replication sets areassigned. The replication sets that do not overlap between the initial status and thereassignment are removed. Only the Orange replication set is removed from the folder. Withthe child folder, the Orange, Green, and Yellow replication sets do not overlap between theinitial status and the reassignment. For this reason, the child folder is not assigned the Yellowreplication set.

To edit scripts, you need the correspondingpermissions.Edit metadata forms and fields (FLAG_EDITMASK) This right enables the user to create new metadata forms and modify existing ones.If you need to edit the keyword lists in the metadata forms, then you also need the right Editkeyword lists.Assign replication sets (FLAG_EDITREPL) You require this right for assigning data to replication sets in the repository. Replication sets areneeded by ELO Replication to determine data quantities.36 Configuration and administrationInheriting rights There are two check boxes in front of the user rights. The left check box refers to the user'spersonal permissions. The check box to the right shows the rights a user takes on by belonging to agroup. If you move the mouse over the right check box, a tooltip appears telling you which groupsthe right was inherited from.InformationIt is recommended to assign the rights via group inheritance and by directly assigning therights to the individual users.37 Configuration and administrationAssign permissions in ELO Spaces The rights for the teamspaces and workspaces in ELO are determined based on the assigned roles.Teamspace You can assign the following special teamspace rights to a role:Edit roles: Edit and create roles in the teamspace, regardless of whether the teamspace itselfmay be edited.Edit teamspace: Make changes to a teamspace. They can also change the roles assigned tomembers in the teamspace and add new members.Delete teamspace: Can only be enabled if Edit teamspace is also enabled.For more information on the roles in the teamspace, refer to the ELO teamspaces documentation.Workspace You can assign the following special workspace rights to a role:Edit workspace: Make changes to a workspace. They can also change the roles assigned tomembers in the workspace and add new members.Edit roles: Edit and create roles in the workspace.

These documents are encrypted at theoperating system level and can only be opened with a password, ensuring that documents aresafeguarded against unauthorized access, even when performing data backups.In addition to the ACL authorization settings in ELO, you can encrypt documents that containconfidential or sensitive information. This also protects documents from being viewed byadministrators at the operating system level.Starting with ELO version 12, documents are encrypted with AES-256 (Advanced EncryptionStandard), a symmetric encryption method that uses block encryption. There are now more than 16encryption keys. Encryption and decryption take place on the server side.Documents that have already been encrypted remain in the old encryption mode. Both encryptionmethods are listed in the database and run simultaneously in a compatibility mode.It is only possible to encrypt a document with ELO functions when it is filed to the ELO repository.Documents in the Intray are always stored in unencrypted format until they are moved to therepository. ELO functions are not designed to encrypt documents already in ELO, because as soonas documents are filed to the repository, the documents may be distributed in unencrypted form toa backup path, revision-controlled media, and various backup systems.Encryption can only be configured by users with the Main administrator right. A user who knows theencryption key and the corresponding password is able to implement encryption. An encryption keyis therefore not necessarily bound to a single person â€“ it can also be used for groups.Documents encrypted with AES-256 can be added to the full text database. To do this, you need tocreate a system user that</s>

Child entries in a foldercan either be folders or documents. Child entries in a document can either be attachments or notes.Example: The permissions to a document only apply for a group and Everyone has permissions tothe notes in the document. In this case, the rights to the document take precedence, so not Everyone will be able to see the note, but only those who also have read permission to thedocument.If a user has permissions to a document but does not have permissions to the document filing path,the document will show up in the results list following a search query or if a link is created.Owner Owner rights The owner rights are a placeholder for the user thatcreates a folderfiled a documentplaces a stamp or any other annotation on a document.started a workflowEveryone Ideally, there should be very few entries in the ELO repository that Everyone has full access to.You can check whether your repository contains such an object by having your administrator set upa dynamic folder in which all objects are displayed</s> 
<s>that permit full access to the Everyone group.To do so, create a folder with the following line on the Extra text tab:Please noteThe Everyone group needs read permissions to personal folders so that services can accessthem. If read permission for Everyone is removed, other users can no longer see the profilepage of this user, for example.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ !+ objects where objacl='75PYJA' and objstatus=053 Configuration and administrationConcept for assigning rights andpermissionsIntroduction The following concept for assigning rights and permissions is merely a recommendation.The ability to assign rights to individual users and/or groups is a standard feature of ELO. Inaddition to this standard feature, users can also assign permissions to folders and documents. Theobjective is to assign users as many permissions as necessary but as few as possible to give themaccess to documents and data.You can assign rights at the user level but in most cases, this is not very effective. It makes moresense to organize users with the same rights into groups and to assign permissions based on thesegroups. The users are then assigned to these groups.This document presents a logical structure for the permissions groups. The intention is to keep thestructure as simple as possible so that it can be implemented in ELO without any problems.The permissions in the ELO repository should correspond to the tasks of the users in the company.The following should be taken into consideration:What tasks do the employees have within the company?In what departments do the employees work?What information and documents do the employees need to complete their tasks within thecompany?â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 54 Configuration and administrationAssigning user rights In response to the first question of what tasks the employee has in the company, we can assignuser rights. Depending on what the data and documents in the ELO repository will be used for, youcan assign user rights via different groups. In our example of a rights concept, we distinguishbetween five different groups of user rights.ELO view users These users may "only" view folders and documents, apply annotations and notes, or write feedposts. They cannot make changes to the metadata, edit, or change the document in any way. Theseusers can perform searches in the repository but do not enter content or file items themselves.55 Configuration and administrationThe role group ELO_ViewUsers (minimal rights) can have the following right:Change passwordELO standard users ELO standard users have extended rights permitting them to edit documents and metadata.Depending on their rights, these users can change or delete documents and folders, change, print,and export metadata, and start and edit workflows.â€¢ 56 Configuration and administrationTypical tasks for these users are to file new documents to the ELO repository and/or to edit them.The role group ELO_StandardUsers (basic rights for editing documents) can have the followingrights:ELO Desktop Client Plus userEdit documentsDelete documentsStart workflowsExtend workflow rightsâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 57 Configuration and administrationELO power users These users are authorized to do more technical and administrative tasks in ELO. Typically, theyedit the folder structure in ELO and its permissions concept. They implement the repositorystructure with</s> 
<s>static or dynamic folders, or with default indexes that can be used by other users.They can edit documents as well as document options or change the expiration date and documentstatus. They can delete non-modifiable documents and versions. They can check the status ofworkflows they are not involved in.58 Configuration and administrationThe role group ELO_PowerUsers (extended rights including editing the folder structure) can havethe following rights:Edit foldersDelete foldersEdit permissionsEdit keyword listsEdit retention periodAuthor for approval documentsDelete versionsView all workflows from all users (check)Delete non-modifiable documentsChange document editing statusELO area administrators These users can manage repository settings for the users they administer as well as theirsubstitutes. They act as administrators for their own departments, are familiar with internalprocesses, and create the required workflow templates. They know what data has to be enteredwhen filing documents and define the required metadata forms and keyword lists. They can createstamps and edit font colors.ELO area administrators are not responsible for editing and working with documents, but forstructure, processes, and keeping the repository in order. They also perform monitoring tasks.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 59 Configuration and administrationThe role group ELO_AreaAdministrators (settings in the repository) can have the following rights:Import permissionExport permissionEdit metadata forms and fieldsEdit keyword listsChange metadata form after filingEdit master dataManage workflowsEdit user data (only for users they administer)â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 60 Configuration and administrationEdit scan profilesELO administrators These users can manage settings in the configuration, as well as scan profiles, substitutes, anduser data for all other users. They can manage organizational units, assign replication sets, removelocks, manage and move document files in the document system, back them up, or delete thempermanently.ELO administrators do not work with folders or documents in the repository, but instead generallyperform administrative tasks only.61 Configuration and administration62 Configuration and administrationGroups and permissions concept It makes sense to combine functions and permissions into groups.To assign different areas in the repository different permissions, we recommend creating specificarea groups. The example below illustrates how you can assign rights via groups and AND groups.Assigning rights via groups Company XYZ has HR, Production, and Logistics departments. The repository provides differentpermissions that can be assigned to the different departments.Membership in the different departments also controls permissions to the documents in therepository. In our example, users from the HR department can access all documents in the HR area,while users from production have access to the Production area and users from logistics haveaccess to the Logistics area. The user groups are created according to the company departmentsfor this reason.The groups assigned via user rights, also referred to as role groups, are combined with the groupscorresponding to department membership.User rights should always be linked to groups and not to individual users. This allows you to track,monitor, and manage assigned rights.The role group or ELO_StandardUsers user rights group in our company has the followingemployees:The HR department has the following employees. They are granted exclusive access to documentsin the HR area.63 Configuration and administrationAND groups The following figure illustrates</s> 
<s>a scenario for assigning permissions within the HR department.Now, we can set permissions to documents and folders in the HR area using an AND group:Members of both the HR and ELO_StandardUsers groups have permissions.This allows you to give all HR employees view permissions to documents from the HR department,for example.64 Configuration and administrationTo ensure that only the ELO_StandardUsers in the HR group are given full access to thesedocuments, we will create an AND group. An AND group contains the overlap from the selectedgroups.65 Configuration and administrationIn this example, the members of the AND group have full access to this document. ELO shows whatemployees are members of this group in the example.66 Configuration and administrationAssigning permissions via metadata forms To ensure that the HR documents can only be edited by authorized users, we recommend definingpermissions using the metadata form and not for individual entries in the repository.67 Configuration and administration68 Configuration and administrationLDAPIntroduction The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables you to import users and groups from anActive Directory (AD) into the ELO system. This is done with LDAP import.You need to set up and configure the connection between LDAP and the ELO LDAP interface for the LDAP import to work.In addition, LDAP authentication must be enabled to allow users to log on to ELO with the datastored in the Active Directory.You will find the menu items in the ELO Administration Console under LDAP.The user administration in the LDAP directory is managed in a tree structure. In this concept, aunique name within the LDAP directory, known as the distinguished name (DN), is used as a uniquekey for each user. An example of a DN is cn=John Smith,ou=people,dc=comy,dc=org. The DN in thiscase is composed of three parts: the common name (CN), the organizational unit (OU), and the domain component (DC). The combination of OU/DC is used to reference different branches within theLDAP tree structure. The DC addresses the top level below the LDAP directory root node. Thisusually represents the Internet domain of the company. The schema data is also located directlyunder the root node. The possible attributes are already specified in the LDAP schema, and thecorresponding values for these properties are saved in the LDAP entry that is resolved through theDN.Please noteDo not use a ; (semicolon) in group and user names in the Active Directory.69 Configuration and administrationLDAP interface configuration The menu item LDAP interface configuration in the ELO Administration Console is where you editthe connection settings, user import settings, and attribute assignment settings of the configurationfile ldap.json. The file ldap.json is stored in the repository under the following path:Administration//IndexServer Scripting Base//_ALL//ldap.jsonInformationPath changes are possible in the following cases:If you want to make a special configuration for an ELO Indexserver, copy the file to thedirectory of the respective ELO Indexserver and make changes to the file there.If you'd like to make different configurations for different ELO Indexservers, you willneed a separate file for each ELO Indexserver.The configuration only applies to a single repository. If you edit the configuration in the ELOAdministration</s> 
<s>Console, you need to restart the ELO Indexserver of the repository. If there aremultiple ELO Indexservers, you need to restart all of them.Please noteYou should not use LDAP to authenticate the ELO Service account (or the service accountused). This allows the server-side ELO applications to run independently of the LDAPconfiguration. Disabling the LDAP connection can cause the ELO applications to no longerstart. In this case, you will not be able to enable the LDAP connection in the ELOAdministration Console.Administrator accounts should not be authenticated via LDAP either.You can make settings for multiple domains.â€¢ â€¢ 70 Configuration and administrationUnder Domain selection, you see a list of available domains.Add (green plus icon): Add settings for a domainDelete (red X icon): Delete the settings of a domainReload data from server (yellow circle arrow icon): Reload the Domain selection areaInformationIn case of connection problems, the ELO Indexserver log file can be set to debug. This makestroubleshooting easier.Connection settings Domain name: Specify the DNS name or IP address of the domain here. The setting is used if the userPrincipalName is derived from the sAMAccountName.LDAP URL The entries in the LDAP URL field determine the TCP connection to the LDAP server.LDAP authentication account: SSO requires a technical account to search LDAP for the user nametransferred by the SSO mechanism (usually sAMAccountName). Enter a userPrincipalName.Please noteThe account must have sufficient rights to read the user attributes and group memberships.71 Configuration and administrationPlease noteWhen using Kerberos: Disconnect the Kerberos account and the LDAP authenticationaccount. The Kerberos account does not have to be created in ELO.LDAP password: In the LDAP password field, you can enter the unencrypted password of the LDAPauthentication account. The ELO Indexserver stores the password encrypted on restart.Connection timeout in seconds: The LDAP interface terminates the connection to the LDAP serverafter this number of seconds. It then attempts to establish a connection with the next server in thelist.Search timeout in seconds: When searching for users or groups, this timeout value is passed to theLDAP server.User import 72 Configuration and administrationDN for person search: Use this field to specify which branches of the LDAP directory to search forusers.Please noteThe list must not be empty.Don't enter too many branches either. The more branches, the more imprecise the search.Search filter for persons: You can use this filter to restrict the search for users.Search filter for e-mails: The first time the user authenticates with an e-mail address, this filter isused to search for the user in the LDAP directory.Required group membership: With this setting, you can use the common name to restrictauthentication to users who are members of a certain group in the LDAP directory.DN for group search: In this field, you specify which branches of the LDAP directory the groups thatare eligible for synchronization must be in. If the list is empty, all groups of the user are included ingroup synchronization.Search filter for groups: You can use this filter to restrict the search for groups of a user.Maximum nesting depth: This field can be used to specify the depth</s> 
<s>of group nesting. This refers tothe collection of user groups for group synchronization.73 Configuration and administrationAttribute assignment Domain prefix: The domain prefix is required if multiple domains are configured and the sAMAccountName is saved as the Windows attribute for the ELO user.There must be a separator at the end of the domain prefix. This separates the prefix from the username. Ideally, you should use a backslash.InformationIf you are using SSO, the domain prefix must match the NetBIOS domain name.You will find the corresponding domain prefix for SSO in the USERDOMAIN environment variable on theclient computer. For SSO with domain prefix, you need to set the option "ntlm.domainUserFormat"in the ELO Indexserver config.xml file. If you set the option sAMAccountName in the Userauthentication via field and specify a domain prefix, the Windows user contains the account namewith the domain prefix in front.Example:sAMAccountName = fritzfreiDomain prefix = ELO\Windows user = ELO\fritzfreiâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 74 Configuration and administrationPlaceholder for ELO user names: The ELO user name can be made up of different LDAP userattributes. You can specify a format expression with placeholders. Enclose the placeholders in $signs. They must also correspond to the LDAP attribute names.User authentication via: In the drop-down menu User authentication via, you can specify whetheryou want to set the sAMAccountName, the userPrincipalName, or the UID as the Windows user attribute(see ELO user manager).Please noteThe setting selected in the User authentication via field must match the settings in the Search filter for persons field (User import tab). Pay attention to capitalization.Any umlauts should also be identical between the Active Directory and ELO user names.The ELO Administration Console checks LDAP for the following four attributes. The ELOAdministration Console uses the first attribute set for the name.InformationSome environments require a custom configuration. This field enables you to enter anyvalues.Supervisor attribute name: In this field, you specify which attribute is used to determine thesupervisor of the ELO user. This is usually the attribute $manager$.Please noteThe supervisor must already exist in ELO.ELO administrator of this user: In the field ELO administrator of this user, you can specify which ELOuser to set as administrator for users created via the LDAP interface. You can enter the ID, GUID, orELO user name.Save attributes in ELO: In this field, you specify which attributes are to be transferred from LDAP toELO.To add an attribute, enter the name of the attribute in the field. Next, click Add ( green plus icon).To remove an attribute, click the X icon next to it in the list of attributes.LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.DISPLAY_NAME,LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.CN,LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.SAM_ACCOUNT_NAMELdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.DISTINGUISHED_NAME75 Configuration and administrationInformationMandatory attributes cannot be deleted. In this case, the X icon is grayed out.76 Configuration and administrationLDAP import With LDAP import, you can import users and groups from an Active Directory (AD) into the ELOsystem.Select server: The ELO Administration Console attempts to find possible LDAP serversautomatically. If this field is blank, no server will be found in the domain. This may be thecase with a VPN connection, for instance.Server: Enter the server for the LDAP connection here. You can also enter the IP</s> 
<s>address, port,or protocol here.BNF: server ::=[ldap|ldaps]://[servername|IP address]:portâ€¢ â€¢ 77 Configuration and administrationPlease noteUse an encrypted connection, in this case LDAP via SSL (LDAPS).Domain user and password: The authentication data consists of a name and password.Ignore certificate validation: The certificate validation can be ignored if needed.Base DN and LDAP organizational unit: These entries are used to select the correct branch ofthe LDAP directory.Filter templates and filter text: Some LDAP filter expressions are already provided in the listand applied to the filter text so that they can be edited.Mapping script: This setting allows you to edit the data as JavaScript code.For more information, see the next section The mapping script.Reset mapping: Deletes the text from the mapping script field.Update existing users or groups: If the name can be resolved to an existing entry, this entryis only processed again if this setting is enabled.Please noteLDAP groups are only read and used when users log on.Create groups in ELO that exist in LDAP: Creates groups that do not yet exist in ELO.Start search: Performs a search and shows the results.Results list: Shows the list of the entries that will be imported. All valid entries are alsoselected. If invalid data is detected during the check, they will not be selected, and a noteabout the problem is shown in a tooltip.The mapping script Default LDAP attributes are automatically mapped to ELO attributes. To allow more flexiblecustomization, JavaScript code can be entered in the input field. This is embedded in a code frameand is performed on every data set in the LDAP search.The ELO Indexserver has a data structure for the users and groups: the UserInfo object.

Once you have donethis, you will see the configuration area under Structures and folders where you can create thefollowing configurations:Basic settingsGeneral settingsStructure and metadata matchingAssignment of user and group rightsBasic settings If necessary, enable expert mode for the next configurations.Integration Client URLIn this field, enter the full HTTP address that is initially used to call the ELO Integration Client. TheURL is structured as follows:ELOix proxy address, path to ELOwf,</s> 
<s>and the ELO Integration Client app. The system comes at theend as well as the ID created in the JSON configuration file.Example:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ http://mbcdemo:9090/ix-MBCDEMO/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/wf/apps/app/elo.integration.Client/?debug=fals8 ELO for MicrosoftGeneral settings Under General settings, you can create configurations for each Business Central object. As soon asyou add a new entry, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadatamatching area. Lines are also created in the Assignment of user and group rights area.BC table: In the BC table column, enter the Business Central table name (database table) you wantto use.Alias: The alias is a technical name you can define yourself. For example, you could copy the entryfrom the BC table field without spaces. The alias is used for unique identification later on.Object description: This field can be used to describe the entry, for example, if you want to providemore information.Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that mayhave to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column, e.g. MBC folderDocument form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use when filing from BusinessCentral. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client configuration file, or aseparate one for each Business Central object.Structure and metadata matching As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, aseparate entry for the alias is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching area.Alias: This entry is copied directly from the Alias column under General settings and can also onlybe modified in this area.9 ELO for MicrosoftRepository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, youcan also enter Business Central variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax. You will find an example inthe chapter Implementation example 'SalesHeader'ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata formdefined under Folder form (see chapter General settings). In our example, this is the form MBCfolder.BC field name: Enter the name of the column in the BC table here.Untranslated (expert mode): Enable this option to return the BC table values untranslated. Theseare the so-called Options. Document Type is such a column, since the Document Type is transferredeither as an untranslated numerical value (e.g.Â 1 for orders) or as text in the current BusinessCentral language (order).Mandatory field (expert mode): Enable this option if you want this field to be mandatory. Forexample, this is important if you are using the value within a path. This can prevent incompletepaths from being created in ELO.ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for MAP fields and enter the technicalname of the field here. In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to thetechnical name. This is useful in relation to the value in Alternative table if a table of lines isspecified there and multiple values can be transferred.If the metadata fields</s> 
<s>do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost andwritten as a warning in the log.Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELOentry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curlybrackets.If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.Please noteIf an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenatedin this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.Parameter: The parameter for mapping from the URL is stored here.Key field: You can select one key field per BC table. The value of the key field is used to specify aproperty of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example,you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. This ensures that an object is not createdtwice (with a new name) in the repository, for example. Instead, the corresponding folder is foundand a new path is created according to the new name. The folder and its contents are moved to this10 ELO for Microsoftnew path. The documents that were stored under the old name remain in the folder with the newname.Filter (expert mode): Enabling this field sets a filter within Business Central. This function can beused if two entries have been created for Sales Header. For example, it is possible to restrict Document Type to use different configurations for orders and requests. Alternatively, you can alsomake the distinction in the path itself using Handlebars.Alternative BC table (expert mode): Enter an alternative table here. A primary key must be used toestablish a relation to the primary table. The classic case is the header table to line table relation,for example, Sales Header as the leading table and Sales Lines as the alternative table.Implementation example 'SalesHeader' General settingsBC table: Sales HeaderAlias: SalesHeaderObject description: Sales Quote/(Blanket/Return) Order/Inv./Cr.

However, the separatorused must be leading, e.Â g. if you enter /Vendor/Orders, the slash is recognized as a separator.Handlebars syntax is also allowed, which enables you to control templates flexibly.If you use Handlebars syntax to create the structure, you can only use metadata from the fields ofthe initial template, in this case MBC folder.Rights for users and groupsReplace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the parent element by default. If the Replace rights optionis enabled, the rights of the parent element are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.Please note that this function only works if a folder structure does not yet exist.Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.RWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.R = ViewW = Change metadataD = DeleteE = EditL = Edit listP = Set permissionsFor more information, refer to the documentation Concept for assigning rights and permissions.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 13 ELO for Microsofthttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/user-management/concept-recommendations/https://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/user-management/concept-recommendations/Working with multiple companies/databases If you work with multiple companies/databases in Business Central but want to manage them in asingle ELO repository, you can add an entry in the integrationservice.config file.After you have confirmed the new entry, you will get an empty configuration interface.You also have to create a new configuration entry in the configuration file elo.integration.Client toaddress the new client.

The ELOinstallation package contains the following files:erp.mbc.outputlinkerp.mbc.outputlink.customConfiguring ELO Output Link for Business Central Once you have successfully installed the ELO packages, you will find the configuration app in theELO Administration Console under:Solutions > ELO for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central > ELO Output LinkClick the ELO Output Link tile to access the configuration interface of ELO Output Link for BusinessCentral.Add client/company First, you will have to add a client or company. Once you have created a client, you can no longerrename it.â€¢ â€¢ 33 ELO for MicrosoftPlease noteOnly edit the configuration in the Business Solutions Custom path to ensure the system canbe updated in the future. When a module is updated, the configuration in the BusinessSolutions folder can be overwritten.After you create a client, the following areas appear for further configuration:General settingsStructure and metadata matchingAssignment of user and group rightsGeneral settings In the General settings area, you define an Identifier. In standard scenarios, this can be the reportID, for example. With customer extensions within Business Central, this could also be an ID definedby development. The identifier helps you identify the configuration entry. As soon as you add a newentry in this area, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadatamatching and Assignment of user and group rights areas.Identifier: In this column, you enter the report ID from Business Central, which is used to printdocuments there, for example.Structure alias: The structure alias is a technical name that you defined in the ELO IntegrationService for Business Central configuration. The alias is used for unique identification later on. It isused to identify the base path where the document will be filed.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 34 ELO for MicrosoftObject description: This field can be used to describe the entry, for example, if you want to providemore information.Version comment: The comment is entered for the document filed from Business Central and isvisible in the document's feed. If a report/an object is printed again, ELO generates a new version,which is saved in the comment/feed with the entry configured here.BC table: In the BC table column, enter the Business Central table name (database table) you wantto use.Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use for documents</s> 
<s>filed via ELOOutput Link for Business Central. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Clientconfiguration file, or a separate one for each Business Central object.Print: A document is filed when a document is printed in Business Central.Event: A document is filed when an event takes place that generates a report within BusinessCentral. The event in Business Central relates to the functions Send/Attach as PDF/Print.Please noteObjects and reports that support the Event function within Business Central should notactivate the Print function. Otherwise, the document would be filed with two versions.Printing can be used as a global event with Business Central.Post: A document is filed when the object is posted in Business Central.Please noteIf technical errors are shown during posting in Business Central (within an object, forexample a customer order, that supports and has been configured for Output Link), BusinessCentral may not correctly forward the event to ELO and the printout of the document will notbe filed.We therefore recommend combining the Post function with the job queue to file anydocuments that have not been filed later on.Manual: A document is filed when a separate function is called in Business Central (Send to ELObutton in Business Central).InformationThe filing functions are not available in all Business Central objects. You will find detailedinformation on which Business Central flags/events there are implementations for in thetable Output Link integration points.35 ELO for MicrosoftOnly one version: No other versions will be filed. If a document already exists, the previousmetadata remain unchanged.Job: As soon as this option is enabled, the configuration entry in a defined entry in the job queue inBusiness Central is used for post-processing or automatic processing. See also Job queue.Structure and metadata matching As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, aseparate entry for the identifier is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matchingarea.Identifier: This entry is copied directly from the Identifier column under General settings and canalso only be modified in this area.Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, youcan also enter Business Central variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.Implementation example for Identifier 1305:ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata formdefined under document form (see chapter General settings). In our example, this is the form MBCPrintedOrder.BC field name: Enter the name of the column in the BC table here.Untranslated (expert mode): Enable this option to return the BC table values untranslated. Theseare the so-called Options. Document Type is such a column, since the Document Type is transferredeither as an untranslated numerical value (e.g.Â 1 for orders) or as text in the current BusinessCentral language (order).Mandatory field (expert mode): Enable this option if you want this field to be mandatory. Forexample, this is important if you are using the value within a path This can prevent incompletepaths from being created in ELO.ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for MAP fields and enter the</s>

This is useful in relation to the value in Alternative table if a table of lines isspecified there and multiple values can be transferred./Printed/{{{DOCNO}}}36 ELO for MicrosoftIf the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost andwritten as a warning in the log.Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELOentry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curlybrackets.If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.Please noteIf an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenatedin this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.Parameter in URL: The parameter for mapping from the URL is stored here.Filter (expert mode): Enabling this field sets a filter within Business Central. If two entries havebeen created for Sales Header, for example, it is possible to restrict Document Type to use differentconfigurations for orders and requests. Alternatively, you can also make the distinction in the pathitself using Handlebars.This filter is used in the context of processing the job queue entry (Job option enabled) (not yetimplemented).Alternative BC table (expert mode): Enter an alternative table here. A primary key must be used toestablish a relation to the primary table. The classic case is the header table to line table relation,for example, Sales Header as the leading table and Sales Lines as the alternative table.Key field (expert mode): You can select one key field per BC table. The value of the key field is usedto specify a property of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes.For example, you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. New versions of the objectare created at the new location when moving the object instead of creating it (and therefore aduplicate) at the old location, for example.Assignment of user and group rights This is where you assign user and group rights.Rights for users and groupsReplace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the folder by default. If this option is enabled, the rightsof the folder are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.37 ELO for MicrosoftRWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.R = ViewW = Change metadataD = DeleteE = EditL = Edit listP = Set permissionsFor more information, refer to the documentation Concept for assigning rights and permissions.Implementation example 'SalesHeader' General settingsIdentifier: 1305Structure alias: SalesHeaderObject description: printed sales ordersVersion comment: Sales Order Printed from MBCBC table: Sales HeaderDocument form: MBC-PrintedOrderPrint: O Event: X Post: XManual: X Only one version: O Job: OStructure and metadata matchingIdentifier: 1305 (taken from</s>

Either your ELO system or at leastthe Indexserver URL used must be able to be reached externally, or you can configure analternative, such as a Microsoft Application Proxy. In any case, your Business Central Systemwill have to be able to reach the ELO system directly.ELO Setup â€“ Output Link In the next step, you need to create the ELO Output Link for Business Central configuration.The Configuration path field is usually already completed. If you want to use a differentconfiguration in ELO, you can modify the configuration path. The configuration path in our exampleis as follows:/erp.mbc.outputlink/Configuration/outputlink.config50 ELO for MicrosoftThe Configuration entry field can be left blank if there is only one configuration entry in the outputlink.config file in ELO. In our example, Business Central uses this one configuration entry.If multiple Business Central systems are connected, the corresponding ELO configuration can beassigned via this configuration entry.Load configurationAfter you have created or checked the configuration path and, where applicable, specified aconfiguration entry, you can import the ELO Output Link for Business Central configuration from theELO system to Business Central using the Actions menu item Load Output Link config. You musthave already completed the configuration in the ELO system (see chapter</s> 
<s>Configuring ELO OutputLink for Business Central).InformationBusiness Central stores the configuration in the cache at this point, so you need to load theconfiguration initially as well as when adjusting the configuration in ELO.If Business Central successfully loaded the configuration, you will see a success message.Last importThis menu item tells you when the configuration was last uploaded from the ELO system.EnableThis function allows you to enable or disable ELO Output Link for Business Central.51 ELO for MicrosoftELO Setup â€“ Check configuration Under the menu item Integration Service configuration (Integr. Serv. config.), you can view andcheck the configured entries in ELO.General Among other things, Business Central differentiates between two types of document reports:reports in RDLC format (Report Definition Language, identifier beginning with 2xx for sales and 4xxfor purchasing scenarios, for example) and Word report layout (beginning with 130* for sales and132* for purchasing). This has to be taken into consideration depending on the customer systemduring creation. To find a used report ID within a Business Central object (for example a salesorder), the ID can be shown via page validation (keyboard shortcut: CTRL + ALT + F1) in thecorresponding report.InformationIn Business Central, the term Report is also used for certain external documents such assales invoices and order confirmations, which you send to customers as PDF files.Source: Documentation for Microsoft Dynamics 365For document reports, the ID can be analyzed via the Report Selection menu.52 ELO for Microsofthttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layoutshttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layoutsVia Report Selection â€“ Sales you can view the reports selected: in this example, report ID 1307 â€“Sales - Credit Memo (in RDLC format) for a credit. The report ID can now be applied to the Output Link configuration.More information is available from the manufacturer (see source in the info box).InformationIn a customer production system, you may encounter customized reports that you will haveto configure as identifiers within ELO.53 ELO for MicrosoftJob queue Within Business Central, you can use job queues to define static automated processes. These allowyou to perform activities within the system without requiring an action. Job queues do not react toconditions within the system, but are instead automatically performed by the system itself basedon a defined pattern. For example, job queues can be used to automatically repeat any failedtransfers, for example when invoices aren't filed to ELO when printed because the server could notbe reached. Job queues can also be used to transfer documents that already exist to the ELOsystem when introducing ELO at a company.Please noteTo use the job queue function, the Job box must be checked for the corresponding reports inthe ELO configuration.Configuration in ELO To file the generated reports/documents in ELO, you will have to define multiple steps. First, youhave to define a field in the Output Link configuration where you can filter the date range for thereports, for example. In our example, we use the field POSTING_DATE from Business Central for Sales invoice â€“ report ID 1306.The value $Job_Range$ also has to be entered in the Filter field in the Output Link configuration.InformationAfter saving the configuration, remember to reload the scripts in</s> 
<s>ELO and to read theconfiguration back into Business Central.Additional filters applying to fixed values can also be defined, for example if you want to selectexplicit reports. In the Filter field, enter the value of the corresponding DocType, for instance. Youcan also enter an explicit date to the Filter field. In this case, only postings/reports on this day areconsidered.Configuration in Business Central Open the Job Queue Entries list in Business Central and create a new report.

When a module is updated, the configuration in the BusinessSolutions folder can be overwritten.After you create a client, the following areas appear for further configuration:General settingsStructure and metadata matchingAssignment of user and group rightsGeneral settings In the General settings area, you define an Identifier. In standard scenarios, this can be the reportID, for example. With customer extensions within Business Central, this could also be an ID definedby development. The identifier helps you identify the configuration entry. As soon as you add a newentry in this area, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadatamatching and Assignment of user and group rights areas.Identifier: In this column, you enter the report ID from Business Central, which is used to printdocuments there, for example.Structure alias: The structure alias is a technical name that you defined in the ELO IntegrationService for Business Central configuration.

If a report/an object is printed again, ELO generates a new version,which is saved in the comment/feed with the entry configured here.BC table: In the BC table column, enter the Business Central table name (database table) you wantto use.Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use for documents</s> 
<s>filed via ELOOutput Link for Business Central. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Clientconfiguration file, or a separate one for each Business Central object.Print: A document is filed when a document is printed in Business Central.Event: A document is filed when an event takes place that generates a report within BusinessCentral. The event in Business Central relates to the functions Send/Attach as PDF/Print.Please noteObjects and reports that support the Event function within Business Central should notactivate the Print function. Otherwise, the document would be filed with two versions.Printing can be used as a global event with Business Central.Post: A document is filed when the object is posted in Business Central.Please noteIf technical errors are shown during posting in Business Central (within an object, forexample a customer order, that supports and has been configured for Output Link), BusinessCentral may not correctly forward the event to ELO and the printout of the document will notbe filed.We therefore recommend combining the Post function with the job queue to file anydocuments that have not been filed later on.Manual: A document is filed when a separate function is called in Business Central (Send to ELObutton in Business Central).InformationThe filing functions are not available in all Business Central objects. You will find detailedinformation on which Business Central flags/events there are implementations for in thetable Output Link integration points.35 ELO for MicrosoftOnly one version: No other versions will be filed. If a document already exists, the previousmetadata remain unchanged.Job: As soon as this option is enabled, the configuration entry in a defined entry in the job queue inBusiness Central is used for post-processing or automatic processing. See also Job queue.Structure and metadata matching As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, aseparate entry for the identifier is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matchingarea.Identifier: This entry is copied directly from the Identifier column under General settings and canalso only be modified in this area.Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, youcan also enter Business Central variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.Implementation example for Identifier 1305:ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata formdefined under document form (see chapter General settings). In our example, this is the form MBCPrintedOrder.BC field name: Enter the name of the column in the BC table here.Untranslated (expert mode): Enable this option to return the BC table values untranslated. Theseare the so-called Options. Document Type is such a column, since the Document Type is transferredeither as an untranslated numerical value (e.g.Â 1 for orders) or as text in the current BusinessCentral language (order).Mandatory field (expert mode): Enable this option if you want this field to be mandatory. Forexample, this is important if you are using the value within a path This can prevent incompletepaths from being created in ELO.ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for MAP fields and enter the</s>

To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curlybrackets.If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.Please noteIf an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenatedin this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.Parameter in URL: The parameter for mapping from the URL is stored here.Filter (expert mode): Enabling this field sets a filter within Business Central. If two entries havebeen created for Sales Header, for example, it is possible to restrict Document Type to use differentconfigurations for orders and requests. Alternatively, you can also make the distinction in the pathitself using Handlebars.This filter is used in the context of processing the job queue entry (Job option enabled) (not yetimplemented).Alternative BC table (expert mode): Enter an alternative table here. A primary key must be used toestablish a relation to the primary table. The classic case is the header table to line table relation,for example, Sales Header as the leading table and Sales Lines as the alternative table.Key field (expert mode): You can select one key field per BC table. The value of the key field is usedto specify a property of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes.For example, you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. New versions of the objectare created at the new location when moving the object instead of creating it (and therefore aduplicate) at the old location, for example.Assignment of user and group rights This is where you assign user and group rights.Rights for users and groupsReplace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the folder by default.

This has to be taken into consideration depending on the customer systemduring creation. To find a used report ID within a Business Central object (for example a salesorder), the ID can be shown via page validation (keyboard shortcut: CTRL + ALT + F1) in thecorresponding report.InformationIn Business Central, the term Report is also used for certain external documents such assales invoices and order confirmations, which you send to customers as PDF files.Source: Documentation for Microsoft Dynamics 365For document reports, the ID can be analyzed via the Report Selection menu.52 ELO for Microsofthttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layoutshttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layoutsVia Report Selection â€“ Sales you can view the reports selected: in this example, report ID 1307 â€“Sales - Credit Memo (in RDLC format) for a credit. The report ID can now be applied to the Output Link configuration.More information is available from the manufacturer (see source in the info box).InformationIn a customer production system, you may encounter customized reports that you will haveto configure as identifiers within ELO.53 ELO for MicrosoftJob queue Within Business Central, you can use job queues to define static automated processes. These allowyou to perform activities within the system without requiring an action. Job queues do not react toconditions within the system, but are instead automatically performed by the system itself basedon a defined pattern. For example, job queues can be used to automatically repeat any failedtransfers, for example when invoices aren't filed to ELO when printed because the server could notbe reached. Job queues can also be used to transfer documents that already exist to the ELOsystem when introducing ELO at a company.Please noteTo use the job queue function, the Job box must be checked for the corresponding reports inthe ELO configuration.Configuration in ELO To file the generated reports/documents in ELO, you will have to define multiple steps. First, youhave to define a field in the Output Link configuration where you can filter the date range for thereports, for example. In our example, we use the field POSTING_DATE from Business Central for Sales invoice â€“ report ID 1306.The value $Job_Range$ also has to be entered in the Filter field in the Output Link configuration.InformationAfter saving the configuration, remember to reload the scripts in</s> 
<s>ELO and to read theconfiguration back into Business Central.Additional filters applying to fixed values can also be defined, for example if you want to selectexplicit reports.

You complete this task using jobs, which you create in the configuration interface.A job allows you to connect a SharePoint library to a folder in ELO. In the process, you can transferinformation from the SharePoint columns to the metadata in ELO. You can also set filters, such as ifyou only want to archive documents that are older than a certain age.The jobs can be processed at scheduled intervals or manually. A document is only archived onceand no other versions are transferred. It is only possible to archive from SharePoint to ELO.The ELO Integration Client enables you to view folders and documents from ELO in SharePoint. ELOfor Microsoft SharePoint simplifies the configuration and provides web parts for Microsoft SharePoint2019 and Microsoft SharePoint Online.ELO for Microsoft SharePoint is a Windows service and can be installed on a Windows serverindependently of Microsoft SharePoint and the ELO Indexserver.

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint connects to the ELO server with this account. It canbe the same server used to log on to ELO for Microsoft SharePoint. We recommend that you createa dedicated account for this.You must also specify a name for the configuration or select an existing configuration. These arestored on the ELO server in the directory //Administration//ELOsp in a folder with the specifiedname. Only one configuration is valid for each ELOsp instance. All settings that are not in the file"appsettings.json" are stored in the instance. Keep in mind that you must confirm a new entry withthe Enter key.Configurations can only be deleted if they are currently not connected to the instance. To delete theactive configuration, you must first disconnect it using the Disconnect button.Next, you configure the SharePoint connection. The account used to log on should haveadministrative rights to all site collections that are to be archived. The URL can be any sitecollection on the SharePoint server.7 ELO for MicrosoftTo support authentication via app ID and certificate, you can check or uncheck the SharePointOnline (Office 365) box in the form.Specify the service URL in the General area for interactive archiving and possible future features.This is usually the same URL as the one used to access the configuration interface. ELOspextensions of the SharePoint interface address the ELOsp service through the service URL.8 ELO for MicrosoftYou can also define the settings for the ELO Integration Client here. Single sign-on must be enabled.For SharePoint Online, you also need to specify the configuration ID for ELOauth. Refer to the ELOIntegration Client chapter for more information.9 ELO for MicrosoftJobs This chapter explains how to configure and manage jobs in ELO for Microsoft SharePoint.Job configuration You can now start to configure the individual jobs.

The web part for the ELO IntegrationClient is also installed here. If this has not been done for the web site collection or library, a redwarning icon is displayed. Click Deploy to open the dialog box.To ensure there are no errors, all steps must be completed successfully (see following screenshot).12 ELO for MicrosoftThe type and number of steps can vary slightly depending on the SharePoint version. If the job issuccessful, you will see the following green message.You can use the Rerun button to execute the job again, such as to enable interactive archiving.Metadata mapping The default fields of the metadata form are completed automatically. For the other fields, you canselect the appropriate SharePoint columns. It is always possible to convert into an ELO text field,and conversion is available for some combinations of ELO and SharePoint types.When you enter text, the columns are filtered, searching the title, internal name, and type. If aSharePoint type cannot be converted to the metadata field type, a message appears.13 ELO for MicrosoftFilters It is also possible to specify up to three filters to restrict the selection of documents to be archived.The filters are linked with AND. This means that only the documents that meet all filter criteria arearchived.14 ELO for MicrosoftThere are two types of filters available:CAML:This filter represents a subset of the SharePoint query language CAML. For more information,especially about the operators, go to:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/query-schemaRegEx:This creates a filter with regular expressions (RegEx).

<s>ELO XC | BasicsELO XCBasicsTable of contentsBasicsConfiguration Exchange Messages Licensing 2 ELO XCBasicsConfiguration Product topology Structure As a service, ELO XC provides a structure in which the configuration of different instances isprocessed. An instance constitutes a separate structure for action trees. Action trees are executed3 ELO XCaccording to a specified order within an instance. They consist of actions that are arrangedhierarchically and logically.ELO XC has flexible configuration options. It offers a variety of parameters for setting the frequencyand scope with which the service is processed, data granularity, and storage of e-mails in the ELOrepository. The configuration of a service is broken down into separate instances whoseconfigurations are processed independently.Each instance contains the definition of the underlying processing settings, a catalog of availablemailboxes, and any number of action trees and configuration templates. An instance is alwayslinked to one repository.Each action tree consists of a message selection based on the corresponding mailbox catalog andits actions.Each action performs a general function and has its own parameters.4 ELO XCFormat and source When the program is started, the ELOxc.xml file (registration file) is read to determine the availableinstances.It contains the address and authentication parameters for each instance. The configuration and thefiling location of an instance are therefore always linked to a single repository. The instanceconfiguration is stored in the repository under //Administration//XC Base//SERVICE and //Administration//XC Base//MANAGER.5 ELO XCThe SERVICE area contains the currently active, executable configurations. The MANAGER areacontains the working versions. This allows you to make more extensive changes to theconfiguration without having to interrupt processing.Once you have completed the changes in the working configuration, you must stop the instanceand publish the working version as a new service configuration. The configuration of the workingversion is copied from the MANAGER folder to the SERVICE folder in the repository. After restartingthe instance, e-mails are processed according to the updated configuration.Action principle An action always returns a binary result: true if successful or false if it fails. By linking the resultsto follow-up actions, you create a binary tree structure, which allows you to configure anapplication-specific logic.The actions deliver functions that affect the scope of the message data, the location in therepository, and the time of transfer, using and evaluating message properties in the process. You6 ELO XCcan create an action tree from any number of actions and call other action trees at any number ofplaces. Processed messages are buffered while an action tree is executing.An action tree returns a binary result, true or false, depending on the last executed action for eachitem processed, which determines how a single message is processed.Configuration and execution levels The configuration of an instance is broken down into three levels:1 Instance level:The basic settings of an instance, such as log behavior or default values, are processed at thislevel. Most importantly, this is also where the connection settings for the mailbox catalog andmailbox access during processing are defined.2 Action tree level:The action tree configurations are evaluated at the level below the instance level. These determinethe scope of selection, which is directly related to</s> 
<s>the settings in the mailbox catalog at theinstance level. This is also where you configure the basic filter settings, e.g. entry points or message classes.3 Action level:The action level consists of any number of individual hierarchically linked actions that changemessage or repository data according to their type. The order of actions in a tree determines thecourse of processing.Validation always takes place while the configuration is loading. This applies both to calling thevalidation function, which is explicitly limited to checking the syntax of fragments and individualplausibility checks, and at the start of message processing. If the validation of the configurationfails, the messages cannot be processed.7 ELO XCExchange Autodiscover Autodiscover is an Exchange service that determines the Exchange server that corresponds to anSMTP address. An EWS connection to the mailbox can only be established once the Exchangeserver has been determined. It makes no sense to directly configure Exchange servers since thesecan change at any time, especially in the Microsoft 365 environment.The address of the Autodiscover service must be available in the runtime environment andautomatically provided by the infrastructure. This is usually done with corresponding entries in thelocal Active Directory and/or DNS. With the appropriate configuration, ELO XC can therefore find andprocess mailboxes across domains.For cases where automatic resolution of the e-mail domain is not possible, the ELO XC connectionsettings provide the option to manually specify an Autodiscover endpoint.Process diagramStatus Component ActionSMTP address APIELO XC attempts to heuristically determine an Autodiscoverendpoint based on the mail domain. It generates plausible URLs,localizes them with DNS, and then attempts to determine theAutodiscover endpoint (svc).AutodiscoverendpointAutodiscoverThe mailbox settings (Exchange version and Exchange URL) aredetermined based on the SMTP address.EWS URL EWS Mailbox authentication and access is possible.EWS authentication and access rights Authentication is required for mailbox access. The mailbox owner usually authenticates with aname and a password. For data privacy reasons, ELO XC should not store these authenticationcredentials. Instead, it uses a service account (ldap) or an app registration (m365) to accessmailboxes. This proxy access (called impersonation) requires elevated privileges and must be setup and configured by an administrator accordingly.If you are only processing a small number of mailboxes, it may also be possible to do without theimpersonation function. In this case, you are able to manually configure mailbox catalogs withseparate credentials.Scenario ConfigurationImpersonationThis access method is mainly used because it is possible to process manymailboxes with one account. ELO XC uses a privileged service connection with itsown account.8 ELO XCScenario ConfigurationDirect accessIf only a few mailboxes are processed, it is possible to configure access to eachmailbox without impersonation (individual static mode).Public foldersThis special case requires a configured service connection with an account that hasaccess rights to public folders.Mailbox types Catalog user shared journal premjournal pubfolderldap X X X Xm365 X X X Xmanual X XThe cataloged mailboxes can be used in ELO XC in different ways. The mailbox types are based onthe RecipientTypeDetails directory property. Some mailboxes can only be used for their intendedpurpose (e.g. user mailboxes), while others can be processed both natively and with emulation(e.g. journal</s> 
<s>recipients).Mailbox type 'user' This type represents a user mailbox and is therefore the standard case. In principle, every availablemailbox can be processed as a user mailbox with the exception of public folders (type pubfolder),in which case there may be no need for advanced processing options. User mailboxes are thenorm, so that emulation of shared and journal mailboxes also traces back to user mailboxes. Alicense is required as soon as a message in a user's mailbox is stored.InformationIn an on-premises installation, create user mailboxes in the Exchange admin center under Recipients > Mailboxes > + > User mailbox. In Microsoft 365, create them in the Microsoft365 admin center under Active users > Add a user.Mailbox type 'shared' Shared mailboxes are group mailboxes that have their own SMTP address and are configured foraccess by multiple users. These users, so-called delegates, have automatic access to the mailboxshare and can act as the owner of the shared mailbox. If this type is configured in an action tree,the messages it contains are processed for all delegates involved. This is what is known asmailbox emulation. ELO XC stores a message for each of the delegates in the repository as if themessage had been found in the respective user mailbox of the delegate. Messages stored in thisway require one license for each delegate.When a shared mailbox is processed in native mode (user type), the delegates are not emulated.Only one message is stored for the shared mailbox but all delegates are licensed for the mailbox.9 ELO XCInformationIn an on-premises installation, create shared mailboxes in the Exchange admin center under Recipients > Shared > +. In Microsoft 365, create them in the Exchange admin center under Mailboxes > Add a shared mailbox.Mailbox type 'journal' The journal mailbox type is a journal recipient that must be configured specifically for an Exchangemailbox store. These mailboxes will then automatically receive all messages related to thecorresponding mailbox store. The original message is attached to an envelope message. This envelope contains a list of recipients, which are then interpreted as user mailboxes duringprocessing. This means that this mailbox type is also emulated. Shared mailboxes are alsoresolved into user mailboxes or their delegates. Each emulated mailbox uses up one license.If a journal mailbox is processed in native mode (user type), the recipients are not resolved, i.e. themailboxes are not emulated. Only the actual message, the envelope with the original messageattached, is stored for the journal mailbox. In this case, all potential journal recipients areautomatically licensed.In addition, all mailbox shares that can also be recipients of the envelope are also resolved.Please noteBCC recipients are recognized according to the Exchange default method and processedsymmetrically if necessary. If BCC recipients appear in recipient lists, they are also retainedon storage. If they show up on journal envelopes, they are also processed as part of mailboxemulation. If you don't want this to happen, you need to set InstanceDef.Addresses.UseBccto false.InformationIn an on-premises installation, create journal mailboxes in the Exchange admin center underServers > Databases > Edit > Maintenance > Journal recipient.Mailbox</s> 
<s>type 'premjournal' Premium journaling is no longer available for Microsoft Office 365. Journaling in Microsoft 365 isnow configured as a transport rule that ensures that journal messages are automatically sent to anexternal mailbox. This mailbox can be on a locally hosted Exchange server or can be an IMAPmailbox. The connection settings in ELO XC must be configured to use the catalog type m365 sothat the emulated mailboxes are known. The journal mailboxes are configured under Staticauthentication. Select premjournal as static mode. Enter the mailboxes as static authentications.As with the journal type, each emulated mailbox uses up one license.10 ELO XCInformationIn Microsoft 365, create premium journaling mailboxes in the Exchange admin center under Microsoft Purview > Data lifecycle management > Exchange (legacy) > Journal rules > Newrule.Mailbox type 'pubfolder' To process public folders, you must select the pubfolder type. The configured SMTP address isusually that of the processing account, since it makes sense to grant the ELO XC service user theaccess rights for all public folders. Access to the public folders is assigned automatically whenestablishing the connection to the service user's mailbox. When storing messages from publicfolders, one license is used up.InformationIn an on-premises installation, create public folders in the Exchange admin center under Public folders. In Microsoft 365, create them in the Exchange admin center under Publicfolders > Add a public folder.Mailbox type 'filter' This type is an exception. It is not used in combination with an SMTP address, but with the name ofa configured catalog filter.Special mailboxes The Exchange server also has other mailbox types that you can include using the instanceconfiguration. These include system mailboxes, room mailboxes, and resource mailboxes. Thesemailboxes are not shown by default. Like user mailboxes, these mailboxes use up one license eachwhen storing messages.Archive mailboxes are secondary user mailboxes used by Exchange to archive old messages. Thesecan be included by enabling an option in the instance configuration. Since repository mailboxes aremapped to normal user mailboxes, no additional licenses are used up.Prioritization The mailboxes are fully resolved when an action tree starts processing. An internal processing typeis defined according to the configuration and duplicate mailbox addresses or SMTP addresses areignored. If duplicates with different mailbox types are found, the address with the processing typethat has a higher priority takes precedence. The following list shows the priority level of theinternal types in descending order:Priority Processing type Configuration type1 Public folders pubfolder11 ELO XCPriority Processing type Configuration type2 Journal journal3 Premium journal premjournal4 User mailbox user5 Shared mailbox shared6 Room mailbox user7 Resource mailbox user8 System mailbox userMailbox catalogs Each catalog is determined by filters, and each catalog type has an internal default filter that isautomatically used if configuration settings are missing. A filter data set consists of filter names,the filter (value), and a search range (container), which is only used for the ldap type.Filter name: Stored internally on every match for use in action trees or list templates.Value: Value for finding matches, depends on the catalog type.Search range: Is only used for LDAP.You can configure as</s> 
<s>many filters as you like. The mailboxes are identified by their SMTP addressesand added to the mailbox catalog along with the corresponding filter.The following table contains the default settings for each catalog type.Catalog Catalog filter (value)ldap (&amp;(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(cn=*)).m365 *Type 'ldap' Special permissions are usually not required for LDAP queries. If this is the case, however, the localadministrator must configure read access to the local AD.The special search range option is only available for LDAP catalogs. These are mainly required forselecting organizational units (OU).Type 'm365' Mailbox catalogs for Microsoft 365 use a remote PowerShell with the module for Exchange Online(EXO module). This connection type requires app registration and authentication using a certificate.12 ELO XCThe permission to use Get-Mailbox (and Get-MailboxPermission for SharedMailboxes) to requestavailable mailboxes is configured in the API permissions of the app registration.If this catalog type is used with premjournal static mode, the retrieved mailboxes can resolve staticjournal mailbox envelopes. This is because Microsoft 365 does not offer journal mailboxes, butredirects to external mailboxes with premium journaling.Type 'manual' Static catalogs contain a list of manually configured mailboxes and the authentication data that canbe processed. They therefore don't need catalog requests or any filters.If the impersonated static mode is configured, only the SMTP address from the list is used to getmailboxes. The service connection data is used for authentication.IMAP servers can only be processed with this catalog type. In this case, static mode must beconfigured as individual and there must be a valid server and port. The static mode premjournal isonly allowed with the m365 catalog type.Mailbox folders Microsoft Exchange uses various predefined folders, e.g. Inbox, Sent Items, or Deleted Items. Thesefolders are managed and identified with technical names at the internal level, whereas thelocalized view in Microsoft Outlook depends on the first user authentication with Outlook. To enableprocessing independently of the language, ELO XC uses the following variables for determination offolder names:Technical name ELO XC variable GroupMsgFolderRoot {%MSGROOT} Standard selectionCalendar {%APPOINTMENT} Standard selectionContacts {%CONTACT} Standard selectionDeletedItems {%DELITEMS} Standard selectionInbox {%INBOX} Standard selectionNotes {%NOTES} Standard selectionSentItems {%SENTMAIL} Standard selectionTasks {%TASK} Standard selectionDrafts {%DRAFTS} Extended selectionJournal {%JOURNAL} Extended selectionVoiceMail {%VOICE} Extended selectionJunkEmail {%JUNK} Extended selectionSearchFolders {%SEARCH} Extended selectionRecipientCache {%RCPTCACHE} Synchronized foldersQuickContacts {%QUICKCONTACTS} Synchronized foldersConversationHistory {%CONVHISTORY} Synchronized folders13 ELO XCTechnical name ELO XC variable GroupMyContacts {%MYCONTACTS} Synchronized foldersIMContactList {%IMCONTACTS} Synchronized foldersPeopleConnect {%PEOPLECONNECT} Synchronized foldersFavorites {%FAVORITES} Synchronized foldersAllContacts {%ALLCONTACTS} Synchronized foldersRecoverableItemsRoot {%RECITEMSROOT} RecoveryRecoverableItemsDeletions {%RECITEMSDEL} RecoveryRecoverableItemsVersions {%RECITEMSVER} RecoveryRecoverableItemsPurges {%RECITEMSPURG} RecoveryArchiveRoot {%ARCROOT} Archive mailboxArchiveMsgFolderRoot {%ARCMSGROOT} Archive mailboxArchiveInbox {%ARCINBOX} Archive mailboxArchiveDeletedItems {%ARCDELITEMS} Archive mailboxArchiveRecoverableItemsRoot {%ARCRECITEMSROOT} Archive mailbox recoveryArchiveRecoverableItemsDeletions {%ARCRECITEMSDEL} Archive mailbox recoveryArchiveRecoverableItemsVersions {%ARCRECITEMSVER} Archive mailbox recoveryArchiveRecoverableItemsPurges {%ARCRECITEMSPURG} Archive mailbox recoveryThese variables are available when the corresponding group is selected under Scaling in theinstance configuration.

If a mailbox also has an archive mailbox, the folders visible in it can befound below ArchiveMsgFolderRoot and are also language-dependent. The roots of the recovery folders are hidden and are not translated but retain their English names.In addition to these four main entry points, ELO XC uses the Public folders root, which cannot beincluded or excluded in the instance configuration, but depends on the mailbox processing settingsin the action tree and the permission settings of its mailbox owner.The Synchronization folder group, on the other hand, has no root of its own, as its only purpose is tosplit the visible Outlook folders even further. Whereas the default selection is always used andâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 15 ELO XCcannot be excluded through the configuration when ELO XC starts processing the mailbox, the Synchronization group allows you to extent the default selection. The Archive mailbox recoverygroup is only available when both the Recovery group and the Archive mailbox group are selected.The roots are each a main entry point into an independent folder structure and have their own ELOXC variable. The table of variables shows additional variables that allow targeted entry points intochild folder structures. For example, if you only want to process Inbox messages and all foldersbelow it, it is sufficient to configure {%INBOX} as a recursive entry point. If you want to process theentire mailbox with all its folders, use {%MSGROOT} as the recursive entry point. If you use non-recursive entry points, only the configured folders are processed. The folders below them areignored.Under Scaling in the instance configuration, you can specify the display names of the five possibleroots. The default values are only a recommendation based on standard use cases. A configurablename is required because the roots are not in different languages and are always part of the folderpath when the EloBoxPath property is used to create the repository path. For example, whereas theInbox folder is perceived as \Inbox due to its visibility in Outlook, this need not apply to the inboxof the archive mailbox. It can be assumed that this folder should not be used as \Inbox as well, butas <em>Archive\Inbox to better distinguish between stored messages by path. However, there isno reason why you can't configure ** and display both roots identically in the filing path.The process of folder determination and the provision of entry point variables at the start ofprocessing is as follows:The known folders are queried by Exchange according to the Scaling settings. The default selectioncannot be bypassed. If an option is not selected, its root is not</s> 
<s>available.ELO XC uses the available roots to build the internal folder cache and select which folders toinclude based on the configured name filters, entry points, and the number of items in each folder.16 ELO XCMessages Properties Messages in Exchange consist of a variety of properties. PidTagSubject, for example, is the propertyname of the message subject. The PidTagMessageDeliveryTime property contains the time ofmessage delivery. There are more than 1,000 defined Exchange properties in total, of which only afraction are relevant for processing Exchange items in ELO XC.Which properties exist and can be used depends on the specific use case. The availability ofproperties depends on the message class. There are usually properties that overlap but someproperties are only available for a specific class. For example, while e-mails and calendar entriesboth use the PidTagSubject property, it makes sense that only calendar entries contain the PidTagStartDate or PidTagEndDate propery.Processing in ELO XC is based to a large extent on message properties. They are used duringselection, validation, or differentiation between cases, or to determine metadata when storingdocuments in the repository. They can also be changed as a result of processing. In addition to theproperties determined by Exchange (PidTags), ELO also uses own properties that are calculated atruntime and contain useful additional information that are not or cannot exist in the regularExchange properties.ELO XC Manager includes utility functions to display the names and meanings of the properties.Message classes The supported message classes are based on the classes officially documented by Microsoft. Theseclasses each have a reliable minimum set of properties that can be processed by ELO XC. User-defined classes may prevent processing in certain circumstances if items of these classes do notcontain the minimum set, which means that ELO XC cannot process the messages. It is thereforerecommended to use mainly derivatives of IPM.Note as user-defined classes. In any case, youshould compare user-defined classes with the officially documented classes and check for missingproperties before processing with ELO XC.The currently integrated classes are listed in the following table.Message class File extensionIPM.Appointment .icsIPM.Conflict.Message .vcfIPM.Contact .vcfIPM.Document* .emlIPM.DistList .txtIPM.InfoPathForm* .emlIPM.Note .emlIPM.Note.IMC.Notification .eml17 ELO XCMessage class File extensionIPM.Note.Mobile.MMS .txtIPM.Note.Mobile.SMS .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM.CA .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Fax .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Missed .txtIPM.Note.Microsoft.Conversation .txtIPM.Note.NotSupportedICal .txtIPM.Note.Rules.OofTemplate.Microsoft .emlIPM.Note.Rules.ExternalOofTemplate.Microsoft .emlIPM.Note.Rules.ReplyTemplate.Microsoft .emlIPM.Note.SMIME .emlIPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned .emlIPM.Note.StorageQuotaWarning .emlIPM.Note.StorageQuotaWarning.Warning .emlIPM.Note.StorageQuotaWarning.Send .emlIPM.Note.StorageQuotaWarning.SendReceive .emlIPM.Post .txtIPM.Post.RSS .txtIPM.Outlook.Recall .txtIPM.Recall.Report .emlIPM.Recall.Report.Failure .emlIPM.Recall.Report.Success .emlIPM.Sharing .txtIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Canceled .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Neg .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Tent .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Notification .icsIPM.Schedule.Meeting.Notification.Forward .icsIPM.StickyNote .txtIPM.Task .txtIPM.TaskRequest .txtIPM.TaskRequest.Accept .txtIPM.TaskRequest.Decline .txt18 ELO XCMessage class File extensionIPM.TaskRequest.Update .txtREPORT.IPM.Note.Delayed.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.Relayed.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.DR.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.NDR.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.Expanded.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.Delayed .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.IPNNDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.IPNNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.SMIME.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.SMIME.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Recall.Report.Failure.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.SharingIPNRN .txtREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Canceled.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Canceled.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request.IPNNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Neg.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Neg.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Neg.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Pos.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Tent.DR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Tent.NDR .emlREPORT.IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Resp.Tent.IPNRN .emlREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Accept.DR .txtREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Accept.NDR .txtREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Decline.DR .txt19 ELO XCMessage class File extensionREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Decline.NDR .txtREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.NDR .txtREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Update.DR .txtREPORT.IPM.TaskRequest.Update.NDR .txtMessage body Message bodies can be in text format and HTML format. Microsoft Exchange also supports RTF,which ELO XC does not support due to its age and support issues with EWS. Processing themessage body in this format is therefore not recommended. The Stubbing action does not workwith this format.If you want ELO XC to change or process message bodies, you have to make sure to use the</s> 
<s>correctformat in some actions. For example, if you want to stub part of the message, the body format isimportant.Microsoft Outlook (and any other e-mail client) will display a formatted message, not the sourcetext of the format. If you want ELO XC to replace Hi! Here is with This is to get the result This ismy message, you have to pay attention to the body format because it significantly influences thesearch pattern.If your message is in text format, you can search for Hi! Here is using a regular expression.However, if the message is in HTML format, you must consider that ELO XC needs to process thesource text instead of the displayed text:This is why it is important that you create the configuration in line with the format of the messagebody if you want to change it. You need to read out the property PidTagNativeBody. If the propertyvalue is 1, the message is in text format. If the value is 3, the message is in HTML format, and ifthe value is 2, it uses RTF. If this property is not read out and, for example, the Match/Replaceaction is used, this could destroy the message format, making it impossible to display the affectedmessages either partially or completely.However, if you use the Stubbing action, you have to configure a template for both formats, whichELO XC automatically uses.<p class="MsoNormal">Hi!< p></ p></p><p class="MsoNormal">This is my message< p></ p></p>o: o:o: o:20 ELO XCHere is a summary of how the message format influences the various actions:Export: Inline attachments in HTML format are not extracted. Only file attachments areextracted.Delete: Inline attachments in HTML format are not deleted. Only file attachments are deleted.Stubbing: Stubbing templates require the configuration of both formats, i.e. text and HTML. Ifvariables are used that generate references (ELO links or other links), inline attachments areignored.Match/Replace: The matching pattern must take the message format into account, otherwisethere is the risk that the source text will be destroyed.Duplicate e-mails E-mails sent to multiple recipients can result in identical MIME files in at least two recipientmailboxes, called duplicate e-mails.Duplicate e-mail: Duplicate e-mails are MIME files delivered by the e-mail server that haveidentical pairs of byte sequences.Multiple recipient e-mail: When an e-mail is sent to more than one recipient, we refer to this as a multiple recipient e-mail.Duplicate e-mail and multiple recipient e-mail: Sending an e-mail to more than one recipient canresult in duplicate e-mails. But this doesn't necessarily happen automatically. It is not possible todeduce the number of duplicate e-mails from the number of multiple recipients.Consequences Duplicate e-mails can only be recognized using the full content of two MIME files. This means thatthere is no way to recognize duplicates unless you compare the content of two MD5 values.Recognizing duplicates would seem to make sense in terms of saving storage space. However, thisis based on the false assumption that you can only avoid redundant storage if duplicate copies areonly stored once. The correct method is to configure an MD5 path as the physical storage path,which automatically ensures that duplicate files</s> 
<s>physically exist only once. ELO calls this methodthe passive duplicate check. Attempting to recognize e-mail duplicates before they are stored is anadditional, unnecessary step that also reduces performance.The message properties PidTagInternetMessageId and PidTagSearchKey provide a direct option todetect multiple recipient e-mails. The pseudo-property EloSearchKey initially tries to use PidTagInternetMessageId, and in the absence of this property, tries to find PidTagSearchKey.Before you use these properties, you need to take note of the following:Determining multiple recipient e-mails is not an adequate substitute for recognizingduplicate e-mails. Pairs of multiple recipient e-mails are not always duplicate e-mails.The two properties not available for all Exchange items and cannot therefore be used in allcases to recognize multiple recipient e-mails.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 21 ELO XCIdentifying all mailboxes associated with a multiple recipient e-mail can also reveal BCCrecipients. It is therefore necessary to consider in each scenario whether privacy regulationsare being breached.22 ELO XCLicensing ELO XC is activated using the license key in ELOam. The maximum number of available ELO XClicenses corresponds to the usercount4 value. ELO XC calculates one license for each processed oremulated mailbox when a message is stored and frees up the license after about 30 days if no newmessages are stored during this period. The available number of licenses can be altered byimporting a new license key. In this case, the date of issue applies.If the number of available licenses is exceeded, ELO XC will continue to operate up to a tolerablelimit above the configured threshold. If usage exceeds this tolerance limit, ELO XC is deactivatedand cannot be used until sufficient licenses are available. One way to do this is to reuse licensesthat are automatically freed up after a certain period or to register a new license key.Please noteGroup mailboxes such as Journal recipients or Shared mailboxes are always fully resolvedwith automatic licensing in order to determine the license usage. For example, if there are20 mailboxes in a mailbox database with one journal recipient, 20 licenses will be used. Thesame applies for Shared mailboxes. If Shared mailboxes are also associated with a Journalrecipient, the delegates of a Shared mailbox also use one license each in addition to theuser mailboxes of the journal.Premium journaling is an exception since it is based on transport rules and not a mailbox database.In this case, there is no limit. All recipients found in the catalog are licensed.Tolerance limit Since in practice, especially with a small number of licenses, mailboxes accidentally configuredincorrectly immediately causes the number of available licenses to be exceeded, the default 20%tolerance limit is only applied starting with 20 mailbox licenses. The following table shows thelicense tolerance of the purchased licenses.Purchased Effective Tolerance [%]1 5 4002 6 2003 7 1334 8 1005 9 806 10 667 11 578 12 509 13 4410 14 4023 ELO XCPurchased Effective Tolerance [%]11 15 3612 16 3313 17 3014 18 2815 19 2616 20 2517 21 2318 22 2219 23 2120 24 2024 ELO XC Table of contents Basics Configuration Product topology Structure Format and source Action</s>

<s>a subtree using a Call subtree action, you can omit theparameter configuration and enter subtree under the type. A subtree automatically inherits theparameters of the action tree being called.Selection restrictions The selection restrictions configure the message search that an action tree performs for eachpermitted mailbox folder according to various criteria.18 ELO XCArchiving status: This setting determines whether a message can already be marked asarchived or not. If the archiving status is irrelevant, it can be ignored.Maximum age: This parameter is set to 01.01.2000 by default and determines the oldesttimestamp of a message. This value is included in the selection of messages.Minimum age: Enter the minimum age in the format ddd:hh:mm:ss. This specifies the requiredage of a message in relation to the selected minimum age property. Newer messages are notselected.Minimum age property: The property usually used is PidTagMessageDeliveryTime (Option sent). Use PidTagEndDate (Option enddate) when processing calendar items. If a minimumage is required depending on the last change to an item, you can also configure PidTagLastModificationTime (Option lastmodified).Minimum size/Maximum size: These values are interpreted as the interval of the permissibleitem size. If you set the value 0 (zero), only interval values that are not 0 (zero) are checked.Attachments: The messages can have attachments (Option ignore), must have attachments(Option yes), or may not have attachments (Option no).Flag 'Read'/Flag 'EverRead': The flag Read determines whether the current message ismarked as read or unread. EverRead indicates whether the message has ever been read,â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 19 ELO XCregardless of the current view. Both flags can be ignored. The option yes indicates that therespective flag must be set, whereas the option no indicates that it must not be set.Body formats: Text format, HTML format, and Rich text format refer to the format of themessage body. If you want to process a message independently of this setting, werecommend that you set ignore in all three values (default setting). In some cases, such aswhen stubbing messages, it can be useful to only select messages in HTML or text format.You could also exclude only Rich text format with the option no. However, if you archivewhole messages and do not carry out any special actions that affect the message body, youcan ignore these three selection restrictions.Ignore item count: With this option, ELO XC also processes folders that do not appear tocontain any items. This can be useful when processing public folders where the item count isnot synchronized.Sensitivity: Message selection can be configured according to sensitivity with the options Normal, Personal, Private, and Confidential.Property restriction The list of property restrictions can also be used to include application-specific processing states inthe selection. A processing state is usually set with the Tag action. Technically speaking, this is a named property that is set as an additional property for a processed item by another action tree.You can use property restrictions to select these properties later on. The Tag action always createsa property pair Elo<tag name>Base and Elo<tag name>Ext for a tag name. If you want to use thetag name</s> 
<s>as a property restriction, you have to use the whole internal name.In our example, the name MyTest is configured in Tag. ELO XC creates the property pair EloMyTestBase and EloMyTestExt. If you want to configure a property restriction for a new actiontree, you need to enter EloMyTestBase or EloMyTestExt as the property name. Base always containsthe processing timestamp and Ext the configured value of the Tag action.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 20 ELO XCIf the usage type exists (default value) is configured, Exchange server only checks whether forexample EloMyTestExt exists (the option missing also exists as well as exists). If, on the otherhand, you also want to include the value of the property in the selection, you must select byvalue.The match mode controls other aspects of the string comparison.Selection restrictions by Outlook category are made with the separate property name Keywords.This property is not one of the Exchange properties (PidTags) but a list of category names managedby Outlook.Selection and processing variables The selection and processing variables help to optimize the processing of an action tree, whichtakes place in three steps:Selection: The program searches for and selects messages.Processing: The actions of the tree are executed for each message.Completion: The message is passed to the change, deletion, or move list.Maximum selection: This option determines the maximum number of selectable items permailbox. 0 removes the restriction.â€¢ â€¢ 21 ELO XCSelection variable and Selection throttle [ms]: The selection variable determines themaximum number of hits for each Exchange search. The selection throttle reduces thefrequency of search requests.Processing variable and Processing throttle [ms]: The processing variable determines thenumber of messages that a worker can load from the Exchange server in a single request.The processing throttle reduces the frequency of these requests.Update list: The update list determines how many internally cached items there are toupdate (Exchange server only). The items are updated when this maximum is reached or ELOXC has finished processing a folder. Attachments are deleted immediately.Deletion list: The deletion list determines how many internally cached items there are todelete. The items are deleted when this maximum is reached or ELO XC has finishedprocessing a folder.Move list: The move list determines how many internally cached items there are to move.The items are moved when this maximum is reached or ELO XC has finished processing afolder.List templates Under Templates, you can create list templates for use in all action trees. Under List templates inan action tree, you can reference the list templates by name. There are templates for mailboxes,entry points, folder filters, and message classes.Mailboxes This area contains all mailboxes that the action tree will process.This list is taken into account in addition to possible references under the list templates. Duplicatemailbox configurations under list templates and mailboxes are automatically resolved. If anaddress was configured with different mailbox types, the mailboxes are sorted according to theinternally assigned processing type.For more information on configuring different mailbox types, refer to the Basics > Exchange >Mailbox types chapter in the documentation.Entry points Entry points are configured as mailbox paths and designate mailbox folders</s> 
<s>that need to be enteredduring processing in order for messages to be selected. Mailbox folders that are not entered usingan entry point, directly or after recursion, are not processed. As in the case of the list templates,duplicate configurations are automatically removed when the configuration is read. If you click the Value field, you get a list of available language-independent variables.Please noteVariables for language-independent folders also depend on the selected global scalingoptions of the instance. Entry points for Exchange archives (secondary mailboxes) must usethe appropriate global prefix of the instance configuration.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 22 ELO XCFolder filters Folder filters are subject to the same purge logic as mailboxes or entry points. They contain foldernames that, when evaluating the folder hierarchy of a mailbox, ensure that positive matches leadto exclusion of folders.Message classes Message classes represent the item type in Exchange. From an Exchange point of view, all itemsare messages that fall into a certain class. Messages can in fact be calendar entries or contacts,which is determined by the class property PidTagMessageClass, which has to be configured as anadditional selection filter in this area. As with mailboxes, entry points and folder filters, theadditional inclusion mechanisms of any possible list templates also apply.23 ELO XCActions Actions are created for action trees, have their own action type, comparable to a function type, andcan be assigned individual names. Whereas an action tree selects messages, the individual actionsare responsible for processing. They are largely configured separately from one another. Exceptionsor automatic dependencies are described in the Automated processes section. The overallarrangement of actions describes the purpose of an action tree. You will get examples of an actionconfiguration when you create a new instance (see Instance overview > Register instance).The result of processing by an action can be successful (TRUE) or unsuccessful (FALSE). Based onthe result, you can configure follow-up actions, which again can be succeeded by follow-up actionsdepending on the result. This series of actions creates a binary tree structure.Messages are processed based on the data loaded by Exchange (message properties). It starts withthe first action and ends when there is no follow-up action. The last determined result of an actionis automatically the processing result of the action tree for the respective message.Before you create the first action, click an action tree in ELO XC Manager and then click thelightning icon.24 ELO XCA drop-down menu showing all available actions appears.Meaning of actions Action Schema DescriptionFiling path ArcPathDef Defines all the paths for storing messages and attachmentsArchive CheckinDef Stores processed messagesPermissions ItemSecurityDef Defines the permissions for the messages being storedResult ResultDef Specifies a constant for the result of the executing action treeExists ExistsDef Checks whether messages exist in the repositoryExport ExportDef Determines the parts of a messageExternal call CallExternalDef Executes an external call25 ELO XCAction Schema DescriptionDelete DeleteDef Deletes messages or attachments in the mailboxTag TagDefTags messages with user-defined properties or OutlookcategoriesStubbing StubbingDef Stubs the body of processed messagesSave CommitDef Saves all changes to a message in the mailboxCall subtree CallDef Calls another action tree that</s>

A filing path consists ofsegments that are created in the repository as SORDs.Please noteIf a path or a path segment already exists, it is used repeatedly.The Filing path action allows you to configure three separate path types for the message (maindocument), for attachments, and for logical references.Metadata template: The metadata template is required for the inheritance of segmentmetadata. The path segments can override this parameter, which is valid for all segments,with their own parameters if needed.Path root: The default archive option creates the filing path globally and in relation to therepository. The user value requires user import to be enabled.â€¢ â€¢ 26 ELO XC'Path segments' options Each filing path configures its own path segments.Unique: Unique means that the configured path must exist only once and should always beused. If this option is not enabled, the path must be identical except for the last segment.However, a new SORD is always created for the last segment. This is particularly useful ifâ€¢ 27 ELO XCyou want to break down messages and store each part in a separate folder. Segment end: Segment end is enabled by default. This means that each configured pathsegment is a separate SORD. If you want a SORD to consist of multiple variables orproperties, you must disable this option until the last path segment is configured for theSORD.Segment type, Segment value: Segment type determines how the segment value is to beused. Setting the constant type means that the segment value is transferred as text. The vartype means that the segment value contains the name of a path variable. The propname andcachedname types set the segment value to a property name.Metadata template: This parameter can be used to override the action metadata template forthe respective segment.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 28 ELO XCSORD type: With the default value 0, the SORD type is set by the ELO Indexserver, which isthe recommended setting. If you require an exception, values between 1 and 253 can beconfigured.Case-sensitive, Start position, Segment length: Case-sensitive, Start position and Segmentlength determine how the character string is subsequently processed.Archive The Archive action stores the data collected during the Filing path and Export actions in therepository.Update path: If the Update path option is enabled, the action can also change the filing pathsof archived messages. All other parameters are ignored in that case.â€¢ â€¢ 29 ELO XCThe action searches for the message in the repository and updates the filing path accordingto the current configuration. This action mode only works if messages have already beenstored.Archiving tag: The Archiving tag option means that the action generates an invisible propertyafter filing, which is useful as selection criterion for action trees.Attach transport header: With this option, transport headers of the MIME file are stored as anELO attachment.Outlook category: The Outlook category allows you to color-code a stored message</s> 
<s>inOutlook.Encryption key: The Encryption key is an optional parameter. It is recommended to set theencryption keys in the metadata form definition and to leave encryption to the ELOIndexserver. However, if the action uses its own encryption keys, you first have to configurethese under the ELO settings in the instance configuration. You can only use references toencryption keys in the Archive action.Links: Links are used to link all stored parts of a message. If you don't want to link them, youneed to set the default value none.Scope of references: The scope of references determines which message parts to logicallyreference. This requires a corresponding filing path of type logref and the configuration of atleast one SORD reference in this action. A metadata search is used to locate the origin of thereference. If the configured value of the property name matches the value of the configuredmetadata field, a logical reference to the stored message parts is created based on theSORDs.InformationYou'll find more information about the metadata search under Configuration > Automatedprocesses > Metadata search (gen. 1 and gen. 2).Permissions The ACLs (permissions) of SORDs are usually set using the metadata form definition to achievestandardized form-dependent results in a repository. If user import is enabled, the ACLs are also setfor the ELO users of the mailbox owners. If both options are not sufficient, this action can be usedto specifically adjust the permissions of stored messages.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 30 ELO XCWhen an action tree starts processing, there are no ACLs set. Every time the Permissions action iscalled within an action tree, the ACLs are set according to the selected configuration. The resetoption enables you to remove ACL settings constructed in this way.An ACL is always assigned to a user or group. The configured permission settings can be added(add) or removed (remove).Result The Result action configures the processing result of the action tree and immediately stopsprocessing the action tree.It makes sense to use this action if you want to reverse the last action result or generate a specificresult message for the log. The result value is particularly important when using result categories.In this case, the wording of the result value can be used to control which counter categories createthe action trees of the entire instance configuration.31 ELO XCExists The Exists action performs two tasks: The first checks whether a message has already been filed tothe connected repository. The second task reads the EloGuid value of the archived message andsaves it to the workspace of the message.InformationYou'll find more information about the metadata search under Configuration > Automatedprocesses > Metadata search (gen. 1 and gen. 2).Export The Export action determines which message parts and associated metadata templates to store.The message is always the main document/item. With the default setting, the entire message isexported in MIME format.32 ELO XCExport mode: The Export mode settings determines how to export the message parts.whole (default): The whole message is exported.split: The message is split into parts.maindoconly: The message is stored without attachments.attachmentsonly: Only the attachments are stored.splitattachments: The</s> 
<s>whole message and its attachments are stored.profile: The configured message properties are written to a text file.jsonfile: The configured message properties are written to a text file in JSON format.Inline attachments: Inline attachments can optionally be exported when separating fileattachments.Main item metadata: The name of the metadata template used for the main item.Attachment metadata template: The attachment metadata template is used for all extractedattachments unless other templates are configured for specific file extensions (e.g. PDF files).Minimum/Maximum size for attachments: The minimum and maximum size of a fileattachment can be used as an additional filter to recognize relevant data based on theexpected size.Property values only, Separator: If propfile export mode is selected, item properties arestored as name-value pairs in a text file. With the default settings, the properties are outputby line (lfcr separator). You can choose a different separator to separate the properties, andyou can prevent properties from being output.'Attachment filter' options If attachments are separated, additional parameters can be configured.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 33 ELO XCThe list of filters for attachments allows you to perform additional regex checks on the names orfile names.Filter type: The Filter type parameter can be used to specify whether to include or exclude anattachment during export.'Property export' options Property exports are configured in profile or jsonfile mode.34 ELO XCWith the profile setting, name-value pairs of the Property export list are written to a text file. Theconfigured separator is used to separate the name from the value. You also have the option not towrite the property names. If you set jsonfile, the configured properties including their name arewritten to the export file in JSON format.External call The External call action allows you to call additional interfaces.35 ELO XCThe call type and target address determine the endpoint of the interface being called. The list ofcall parameters is passed to the interface.Call type Target addresshttp URL of web interfaceix Name of the registered functionwf Name of workflow templatefeed Feed actionIf you select http as the type, you can use a HTTP parameter type to define how a parameter ispassed. HTTP authorization allows you to specify whether to authenticate using the ELOIndexserver or the JSession cookie. Both options are needed for browser access using the ELOIndexserver (e.g. for plug-ins).Configuration example for a registered IX function An external call (CallExternalDef) from registered IX functions resulted in errors if returns weremissing. This change prevents the error. Return values are also logged. The following examplesillustrate the principle of registered IX functions.InformationThese examples are only a short demonstration and do not include a parameter check inJavascript.36 ELO XC37 ELO XCELO XCarc: XC RFsarc > At al iea Lf Administration function RF_HelloNull(ec, args) {> OR Dropzonefunction RF_HelloNullReturn(ec, args) {(Rf ELO Background Images return null:> BR ELOapps :G ELOas Base function RF_Hello(ec, args) {return "Hello":> [R ELOwf Base }> CR Fulltext Configuration function RF_HelloArgs(ec, args) {return "Hello Arg 0: "+ args[0);GR HTML Templates }4 (BR indexServer Scripting Base> GR_ALL4 QR etc| [) XC RFsThe name of</s> 
<s>the registered function has to be used as the target address. The parameters arealways passed in the order of the configured call parameters. On transfer/call, a parameter fieldcontains the value determined at runtime based on the configuration. The example configures thecall for the first example function. In the worker log, you will therefore find the result null. If XCcalls RF_Hello, Hello appears in the log. The example RF_HelloArgs should show the SORD GUID ofthe message filed previously in the log.InformationRegistered IX functions offer the most flexible and extensive options for completingsupplementary tasks for XC processing and should therefore always be considered forfollow-up processes in e-mail archiving. In such cases, long-running IX operations (e.g.search operations, volume-dependent/document-dependent evaluations, etc.) should beavoided. Durations in the IX calls of multiple seconds are already beyond the limit of what isconsidered sensible in bulk processing.38 ELO XCFig.: Configuration example for a feed action The external call (CallExternalDef) for feeds does not allow you to pass ELO properties. This changeextends CallExternalDef so that these properties can be used. The goal of this external call type isto configure a message as a feed action, for example to inform users of incoming messages. Theproperties files define the localized message text to be shown. The freely selectable variables/parameters of the message are listed numbered in curly brackets.39 ELO XCIn the figure above, you can see how the feed action can be configured in ELO XC.The name of the properties file is the call target. The text key named key has to be entered as thefirst call parameter (both are mandatory). The other call parameters are determined at runtime andtransferred in the order they are configured to generate the feed action. The order of the callparameters should correspond to the numbering of the text variables.Delete The Delete action is used to delete messages from mailboxes.Please noteBecause the Delete action takes effect immediately, no other follow-up actions may beconfigured with the exception of the Result action.40 ELO XCSecured: The Secured parameter specifies whether the message must exist in the repository beforedeletion. This is checked using the archiving tag and requires the message to have been stored inthe repository.Delete range: The delete range specifies whether to delete the entire message or just theattachments. The list of deletion filters allows you to perform additional optional checks. If item isselected, the program performs a regex match on the subject line. If attachment is selected, theattachment name is checked.Tag The Tag action provides different options to tag messages.Please note41 ELO XCEnd processing: If this check box is enabled, ELO XC is instructed to never select or processthe message again. This can be a useful option to set if you want to reduce the selectionscope of action trees. However, you should consider whether you really want to do this.You set the tags in the Status tags area.Delete: You also have the option to remove existing tags.Status name, Status value: A tag consists of a status name and a status value. The statusname is converted into an internal</s> 
<s>format during processing.In the example, the property names EloProjectMessageBase and EloProjectMessageExt aregenerated from the status name ProjectMessage. The base property is a timestamp, and the Ext property is assigned the value.Tag type: If you select the string tag type, the tag is a constant property value. If you selectthe prop tag type, the value must be a property name. In this case, the action inherits theproperty as the status value. The tag property value is a copy of another property.Outlook category: You can also tag the e-mail with a specific Outlook category.Stubbing The Stubbing action replaces message bodies according to a specific template.Stubbing: Stubbing is the name of the stubbing template (see Templates > Stubbingtemplates.Address pattern: The Address pattern field is required for generating links to archivedmessage parts. For this to work, the message parts must have been stored in the repositoryand their GUIDs must be available (see the Archive and Exists sections).Reference field: The reference field contains the metadata name that can be used todetermine extracted attachments with their GUIDs.InformationYou'll find more information about the metadata search under Configuration > Automatedprocesses > Metadata search (gen. 1 and gen. 2).â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 42 ELO XCSave Changes to a message do not take effect until the Save action is executed. This does not apply tochanges to the Delete and Move actions.Read marker: The read marker sets the bit in PidTagMessageFlags that displays the Outlookmessage as read.Call subtree The Subtree call action delegates execution to another action tree that is configured with the subtree type.Subtree name: ELO XC identities the subtree being called by name. If the name you enterdoes not exist, validation of the instance configuration will fail.During processing, the action goes straight from the subtree call to the first action in the subtree.Message selection does not occur with subtree calls. In this case, the respective parameters areignored but not deleted.Abort condition: The Abort condition determines the subtree result (subtrue) or (subfalse)which causes the loop to stop processing.Abort message: A loop can also be terminated if it matches a configured abort message.Number of retries: Number of retries determines how many times to call the subtree whenthe action is executed. This usually happens once but it can be useful to make loop calls insome cases. The maximum number of retries is 10.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 43 ELO XCMatch/Replace The Match/Replace action allows you to read out and change message properties. This action canbe used to make decisions, configures branches, and change properties in an action tree.Action type: The action type determines whether to only read (match) or to replace (replace)configured properties. The action configures a list of message properties, which it thenchecks and/or replaces using a list of regex configurations.Evaluation logic: If the evaluation logic cnf (default) is selected, the action is successful ifthere is at least one successful regex configuration for all properties. If you select dnf, theaction is successful if all regex configurations are successful for at least one messageproperty.The action terminates as soon as</s> 
<s>the required condition is not met. In addition, all propertyvalues used are stored and restored if the entire action fails.Property value: The allowed property names are generally PidTags. ELO properties are onlyallowed with the match type as they are only available for read access.Destination: With the action type replace and the destination element (default setting), allchanges to properties occur in the message itself. If cache is selected as the destination, ELOXC writes the changed value to an internal cache, which is available during processing. Thisallows you to change properties without changing the message. These values can also beaccessed with the source type cachedname (see Automated processes > Properties).â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 44 ELO XCRegex options: The configuration of a match/replacement is bound to the internal options forregular expressions.Matching pattern, Matching pattern (upper limit): The matching pattern determines the regexmatch condition. If you configure an interval check, the property value must be within thelower limit and the upper limit of the matching pattern. This option can be used for calendar,time, and number properties.Replace The Replace parameter for the replace type determines the regex expression that isused to replace the property value if the pattern was successfully matched.The calendar formats allowed to configure the lower and upper limits of the interval check are(0stands for valid numbers of the corresponding date part):00000000000000 (14 digits): This is the ISO date format in the order year, month, day, hour,minute, and second. The year has four digits and the other parts have two digits. The intervallimits are interpreted statistically.Age000000000 (9 digits): This format triggers and interval check of the age in relation to thejob start(difference between job start and matching pattern). The order of the digits is day,hour, minute, and second. The days have three digits and the other parts have two digits. TheAge prefix is case-sensitive.Map0000000000 (10 digits): This format requires the Map prefix. This option is case-sensitive. The digits represent month, day, hour, minute, and second. All parts have twodigits. Besides numbers, XX are allowed instead of valid date parts. If part of the date in thepattern contains numbers, they are used in the interval threshold. If a part of the patterncontains XX, the numbers in the part of the date are copied from the property value.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 45 ELO XCMove The Move action can be used to move messages to other mailbox folders.Please noteBecause the Move action takes effect immediately, no other follow-up actions may beconfigured with the exception of the Result action.The configuration of this action supports multiple target folders, which are selected in sequenceduring execution. If the action fails, the next mailbox folder is selected as the target until themessage is successfully moved. This is often the case if you don't want ELO XC to create the path.Create path: If you select the Create path option, ELO XC creates the mailbox folder to beused as the target if it doesn't already exist.Please noteMoving a message will render the data invalid. This is because the mailbox path is</s> 
<s>part ofthe message identifier. It is therefore necessary to save all changes before moving amessage (see Save section). Once it has been moved, you should not configure any actionsin the action tree other than the Result action because there is no more data linked to themessage.â€¢ 46 ELO XCTemplates Usage Templates allow you create configuration fragments that you can use again. They have uniquenames. Most template types are lists that you can refer to in the configuration of an action tree,which not only makes it easier for you to create the overall configuration, but can also be used tocreate processing instructions for the instance.For example, if you only wanted process certain message classes, you could configure a templateof the allowed classes. You could also use a folder filter template to exclude specific mailboxfolders, regardless of whether they appear in the mailbox structure or not. You can create listtemplates for action trees for catalogs, entry points, folder filters, and classes.The most important template is the one for importing metadata into the ELO repository. ELO XCtherefore provides a default metadata template for stored messages and filing paths (see Metadatatemplates).The configuration of a stubbing template is mandatory when using the associated action(StubbingDef). This defines the content that is created when the message is stubbed. It isnecessary to distinguish between HTML and text format.If you click the Templates node, you will find the templates that have already been created. You cancreate new templates by clicking the star icon and selecting the desired template type from thesubmenu.47 ELO XCA drop-down menu with available configuration templates opens.The following configuration templates are available:Entry point templateClass templateMetadata templateFolder filter templateMailbox templateStubbing templateList templates List templates are lists used by action trees to reduce the number of configuration steps requiredand to ensure that different trees use the same selection lists.You have the option to extend the configuration areas of an action tree by importing additional lists.They are added under List templates.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 48 ELO XCEach action tree can use any number of templates. Multiple occurrences of list items areautomatically detected and removed. Additional configurations of list items in the action tree aremerged with the imported items from the respective list template.For example, you can create a mailbox template.49 ELO XCAdd mailboxes.50 ELO XCRefer to this template in the action tree by name.The imported mailboxes xc161 and xc162 with the mailbox xc191 specifically for this action treewill be merged into one list {xc161, xc162, xc191}.The list templates for folder filters, entry points, and message classes are configured in the sameway.51 ELO XCMetadata templates ELO XC uses metadata templates to transfer properties to the metadata fields of an ELO metadataform so that additional information can be transferred to the repository and used along with themailbox items. The templates KWDEFAULTDOCUMENT for e-mails, and KWDEFAULTFOLDER forfolders in the filing path, are statically integrated by default. They are created again if missing.52 ELO XCIn addition to assigning values to the metadata fields, a template is used to set the correspondingform,</s> 
<s>whose settings (e.Â g. access rights) the Indexserver takes into account when transferring themessages to the repository.Template name: The template name is referenced in the Export action.Metadata form name: The form is specified by its name (see ELO Administration Console).SORD types: These parameters assign the appropriate icon types to messages and messageswith attachments in the repository.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 53 ELO XCELO reference: If an attachment is extracted from a message and transferred to ELO, theGUID of the message is assigned to this metadata field. This enables actions such as Existsand Stubbing to establish a relation between the message and attachments in ELO.ELO map: This value is the name of the map domain if you want to store metadata internallyin an ELO map. For example, the Objects value is required to store metadata in Additionalinformation.Set file name: This option populates the ELO_FNAME global metadata field.Metadata fields The metadata fields can be determined in different ways at runtime. It is possible to return a list ofvalue matches for each metadata field. The metadata value can be set if these actions aresuccessful.â€¢ â€¢ 54 ELO XCThe values of the property EloRecipientsTo are transferred to the metadata field ELOOUTL2 if theycorrespond to the pattern .*. Using the wildcard .* means that the match is always successful andall property values are transferred to the metadata field.Metadata name: This is the group name of the metadata field. If using an aspect metadataform, you enter the name of the aspect mapping here.Output target: Specify here whether you want the result to be written to metadata fields, anELO map in ELO XC, or both. The aspect setting means that the configuration is based onorganization of data with aspects and the metadata template should use aspect mappings.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 55 ELO XCOutput form: By default, the results are output to a column index. Alternatively, you canstring lists without column separators as a single character string or configure them asindividual output with custom (see Output and Match ID).Custom output: If you select the output form custom, this parameter contains the outputpattern that you can define individually and assign the individual results of the evaluation viathe match IDs. A match ID is entered as {ID}.Separator: You apply the output separator to properties whose values are based on lists if theoutput form is concat.Mapping ID: This field is completed for custom output of the property values in metadatafields or mapping to aspect fields. In case of custom output, you can choose any identifier. Tomap the value on an aspect field, the technical name of the aspect field has to be selected.Property name: This field contains the name of an Exchange message property or ELOproperty. Double-click to display a filtered list of available properties.Property source: The default value propname determines that the field should be assigned aproperty value. You can use cachedname to specify that the field is assigned a previouslymodified and cached value of the property. The constant and var options are required in otherfragments and are not valid in metadata</s> 
<s>templates.Action type: With the default value match, the property value is inherited on a successfulmatch. With replace, the value is modified according to the Replace parameter before beingtransferred to the metadata field.Regex options, Matching pattern, and Replace evaluate the property using regularexpressions.Stubbing templates Please noteELO XC provides the stubbing function for compatibility with previous versions. However, itshould not be used. Microsoft discourages the use of message stubbing because it does notimprove Exchange performance as originally intended. The number of mailbox itemsincreases the load on Exchange more than their collective size. The best way to improveperformance is to reduce the total number of mailbox items. In addition, administrativeissues can arise in the long term due to obsolete references, so stubbing only makes senseif the ELO references created in the message bodies and Exchange server performance arenot important in the long term.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 56 ELO XCStubbing is a function that replaces parts of an e-mail with external links or new contents. In ELOXC, stubbing is based on templates (stubbing template) that are used in an action (Stubbing).The template contains two parts. One part is for stubbing messages in text format and the otherpart is for messages in HTML format. ELO XC recognizes the format of each message and uses thecorresponding part of the template. Messages in rich text format cannot be stubbed and areignored with a corresponding error message in the log.Variables A template represents the new body and supports the use of stubbing variables. These variablesare always written to the stubbing template as {%VARIABLE}. The available variables are:IX: This variable is replaced by the URL of the corresponding Indexserver.ARCNAME: This writes the name of the repository to the body.ARCDATE: This variable returns the date and time of archiving.DELDATE: This variable returns the date and time of stubbing.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 57 ELO XCLINK: This generates a Web Client URL that refers to the archived e-mail.ATTLINK: As with the variable Link, this variable is used for extracted attachments.ECD: This variable ensures that ELO links of the archived e-mail and all its attachments areattached to the e-mail.BODY: This variable returns the whole message body.HTMLBODY: This variable can only be used in HTML format and ensures that the previousmessage body remains in HTML format. At the same time, all variables except ECD areignored.GUID: This variable is not used in templates but in the Stubbing action, where the ELO WebClient URL is configured as a link template.Time formats The standard assignment of the time variables ARCDATE and DELDATE is as follows: {%DELDATE:UTC:ISO:en-US}.It is possible to configure additional format requirements by separating them with colons. If UTC isomitted, the local time is used. If you do not want to generate an ISO date with the format YYYYMMDDhhmmss, you can use one of the following specifications instead:D: Short date patternd: Long date patternf: Complete date/time pattern (short term)F: Complete date/time pattern (long term)g: General date/time pattern (short term)G: General date/time pattern (long term)t: Short time patternT: Long time patternHowever, these abbreviations</s>

This URL must also contain the GUIDvariable in this case. ELO XC generates the correct URLs in the stubbing process.ELO reference: In addition, you need to set the ELO reference parameter so that the GUID ofthe e-mail is saved to this metadata field when extracting attachments. Otherwise, ELO XCcannot determine the values of the variable ATTLINK.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 60 ELO XCAutomated processes Action principle Configuration using the action principle enables you to create complex instance configurations witha modular structure. A job traverses the action trees of the configuration one after the other anduses an Exchange search to select the items within the retrieved mailboxes that are to beprocessed.The tree structure is traversed for each Exchange item found. The item data is loaded according tothe configuration. The item properties are always unique in the entire action tree, regardless of howoften an action type is traversed.The minimal configuration of an action tree for storing messages consists of a filing path in therepository, a MIME export, the storage action, and subsequently tagging and saving the message.The filing path in the repository and the MIME document are required for successful storage. The "archived" tag is set during storage and subsequently saved.If an action type is traversed multiple times prior to storage, only the most recently used value isallowed.For example, Filing path 1 is overwritten with Filing path 2 before storage. Only Filing path 2 will beused from now on. This process of automatically writing a value when an action is repeated alsoapplies to message exports.61 ELO XCThis tree uses different filing path and export types for messages with and without attachments. Itshows how instance configurations become more complex as they grow and actions are notstructured in a meaningful way.62 ELO XCThis figure clearly illustrates that the action is split up</s> 
<s>into two similar branches. This structure ispossible because the order of the actions before storage is irrelevant. Filing path and export actionscan be executed any number of times in succession.However, this tree also shows that despite the structure with two main branches, the actions File toELO and Save as "archived" must be configured twice. This can also be prevented by configuringand calling subtrees.If you call the Filing path and export subtree, the message is not filed to ELO and saved. Bothactions are only required once.Subtrees are executed irrespective of the selection settings since the items being processed havealready been selected by the active action tree. A subtree therefore only requires minimalconfiguration.63 ELO XCIn this example, however, the amount of configuration has not yet been reduced since althoughthere was no need to configure File to ELO and Save as "archived" twice, the amount ofconfiguration stays the same by adding the subtree and the subtree call.As soon as additional case distinctions are added, the benefits of the subtree outweigh thedisadvantages.The advantages of using subtrees only become really apparent when decisions (e.g. type of filingpath or export) are required in different action trees.64 ELO XCProperties There are two types of properties: PidTags and ELO properties.PidTags are defined by Microsoft Exchange. Their availability depends on various factors such asmessage class, transmission status, message formats, and occasionally internal Exchangesettings. There is no way to determine a complete set of properties fÃ¼r a message before aproperty is accessed.The number of properties read at the start of processing depends on the configuration of an actiontree. Every time a PidTag is used in an action, it is loaded with the message and is available untilthe action tree is completed.These properties can be changed as the actions are executed. However, changes to a message arenot saved in Exchange until the Save action is executed. Some actions allow the use of workingcopies (see cachedname). These copies allow you to change message properties during processingand use them in ELO without overwriting them in the original message on saving.PidTags are designed for use with different data types. ELO XC supports individual values of strings,numbers, time values, and currencies. Binary data, Exchange references, and value lists of anytype, including those of the supported values, are ignored and are not available in XC.ELO properties are recognized by their prefix. They provide calculated values that are relevant formessage processing in ELO XC and for which there are no PidTags. They are calculated internallyaccording to the current processing state but cannot be changed.Metadata ELO metadata is required whenever SORDs have to be created. This applies to filing paths in therepository and the storage of messages and/or attachments as documents. They are configuredwith metadata templates that are incorporated in the Filing path and Export actions. The metadataare retrieved during the execution of these actions and written to the repository when the Archiveaction is executed.Each generated SORD can have its own metadata in filing paths.65 ELO XCThe configured template is valid for all path segments if the Metadata</s> 
<s>template parameter isempty.You need to configure a custom template to write alternative metadata for a path segment.66 ELO XCThe Export action distinguishes between the main document, i.e. the message and its attachments.Metadata searchÂ (gen. 1 and gen. 2) At various points when configuring an instance, you have the option to specify parameters thattrigger a metadata search. For example, the Exists action uses an identification field that identifiesstored messages based on a search term (e.g. PidTagInternetMessageId or PidTagSearchKey). Theinternal reorganization from gen. 1 to gen. 2 metadata also brings a change in the namingconvention. A metadata field (index field in gen. 1) was referenced by its group name alone(objkeys table, okeyname column). In this case, you only needed to enter the field name in theconfiguration. With the more flexible data model in gen. 2, it is only possible to determine a field bytaking into account what it is being used for, which is done through the concept of aspects, theassociated fields, and mappings.An aspect-based metadata search also requires the configuration of a field. If there are ambiguouspossibilities, you need to specify the associated aspect of the data set that a field belongs to. Thiscreates a type of search path with the following general input syntax:67 ELO XC[aspect]Â¶[field]Aspect mappings configure how aspects and their fields are used in metadata forms. The metadatasearch also takes the mappings into account with the following general input syntax:[mapping]Â¶[aspect]Â¶[field]This three-digit notation enables you to search for specific fields by their membership in aspects.The aspects are associated with specific metadata forms. It is also possible to search by specifyingthe field name only, ignoring metadata form assignments and aspect restrictions. However, thisaffects the search time due to the complexity of the process. For details, refer to the findByIndexsection in the Indexserver interface documentation.ELO XC always uses the metadata search independently of the metadata form. This means thataspect mappings, the first part of the notation, are not supported. The third part can be interpretedas the counterpart to the group name in gen. 1 and therefore does not require any specialconsideration. The second part of the notation is important in terms of the potential number of hitsand the search time.Aspects are associated with a specific package (package or namespace). For example, an ASPADDRESS* aspect can exist in the MESSAGING package and in the DELIVERY package at thesame time. Therefore, an aspect is always noted with specification of the package, in this case MESSAGING.ASPADDRESS* or DELIVERY.ASP_ADDRESS. If you look at the aspect table, you will seethat there are two different aspects. Normally, the aspects that are relevant for ELO XC are all inone package. In most cases, notations of the form Â¶[aspect]Â¶[field] are sufficient, which would beÂ¶MESSAGING.ASP_ADDRESSÂ¶name in this case. You can also search for the field without specifying theaspect, e.g. with Â¶Â¶name, but it will take considerably more time and ELO XC triggers the searchqueries for each processed item. This is why it is important to avoid having ambiguous packages,although this of course cannot be ruled out entirely.ELO XC combines the</s> 
<s>simple group name notation with the more complex notation of the aspect-based metadata search using the | separator symbol. The general input syntax looks like this:[gen. 1]|[gen. 2]For example, if 90% of all stored messages were organized with gen. 1 and 10% with gen. 2, and ELOOUTL3 was used for gen. 1 and EMAIL.ASPECT_ID.EMAILID was used for gen. 2, 100% of the storedmessages are taken into account in the metadata search for the ELOOUTL3|Â¶EMAIL.ASPECT_IDÂ¶EMAILID notation.Permissions ELO XC supports several different options for assigning permissions to stored messages. However,keep in mind that not every mailbox has its own ELO user account. It is therefore recommendedthat you create a main folder with exclusive access for the mailbox owner before processing amailbox for the first time so that the stored message contents are not compromised. The defaultconfiguration in ELO XC uses the forms Folder and E-mail whose permission settings are alreadyconfigured for this case and automatically inherit the permissions of the main folder.68 ELO XChttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/de-de/elo-indexserver/status-configuration/status-page.html#resourceshttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/de-de/elo-indexserver/status-configuration/status-page.html#resourcesThe ELO Indexserver LDAP interface is the standard way to import users from the externaldirectory. For more information on LDAP interface configuration, refer to the documentation at Configuration and administration > User management > LDAP > LDAP interface configuration.ELO XC can use this interface directly. When importing users from the external directory using ELOXC, you must ensure that no conflicts with existing user data occur. ELO XC identifies existing userswith the properties objectGuid, SAMAccountName, UserPrincipalName, and mail. If there is nomatch, the mailbox owners are created as new ELO users.If the storage paths are configured accordingly, mailbox owners who are identified as ELO users canhave personal folders in the repository that only they have access to, which ensures that messagecontents are not compromised on initial storage.The Permissions action can be used to configure existing users/groups who will have additionalaccess to the stored messages.69 ELO XChttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/de-de/user-management/ldap/ldap-interface-configuration.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/de-de/user-management/ldap/ldap-interface-configuration.html Table of contents Configuration Instance Processing settings Connection data ELO settings Scaling Recipients Additional settings Action trees Configuration Selection restrictions Property restriction Selection and processing variables List templates Mailboxes Entry points Folder filters Message classes Actions Meaning of actions Filing path 'Path segments' options Archive Permissions Result Exists Export 'Attachment filter' options 'Property export' options External call Configuration example for a registered IX function Fig.: Configuration example for a feed action Delete Tag Stubbing Save Call subtree Match/Replace Move Templates Usage List templates Metadata templates Metadata fields Stubbing templates Variables Time formats Example Automated processes Action principle Properties Metadata Metadata searchÂ (gen. 1 and gen. 2) Permissions</s>

We recommend using at least Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. Forinformation on how to configure the TLS version for Windows systems, refer to the Microsoftdocumentation.The Tomcat server.xml file should look like this:<Connector SSLEnabled="true" ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256" clientAuth="false" keystoreFile="C:\keystore.jks" keystorePass="aaa" maxHttpHeaderSize="65536"7 ELO XCThe keystoreFile, keystorePass, and port properties must be adapted to the respective serverinstallation. Make sure that you enter the cipher suites TLSECDHERSAWITHAES256GCMSHA384*and TLSECDHERSAWITHAES128GCMSHA256*. If you make changes in the server.xml, you have torestart the ELO server.If you have activated the correct TLS version in the system, configured the server.xml as described,and ELO XC still cannot establish an SSL connection to the Indexserver, you can try removing the ciphers property from server.xml.If this also fails, you can still try to enter TLS version 1.1 as well:PowerShell cmdlets Please noteThe following PowerShell cmdlets illustrate what needs to be done to establish a successfulPowerShell connection to Microsoft 365 Exchange Online. You can find the completedocumentation and help for troubleshooting issues on the Microsoft website. In particular,the examples used here may not be as complete or up-to-date as the current software.Certificates When generating a self-signed certificate, you should copy the fingerprint from PowerShell and saveit separately for use in other cmdlets or the ELO XC configuration.This is how you create a certificate: maxThreads="1000" port="9093" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="https" secure="true" sslEnabledProtocols="+TLSv1.2,+TLSv1.3"sslEnabledProtocols="+TLSv1.1,+TLSv1.2,+TLSv1.3"New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "dns.name" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter 8 ELO XCThe DnsName parameter must not contain any wildcards. The ELO XC host certificate (Z3) requiresthe local fully qualified domain name (FQDN), whereas the app registration certificate (Z4) requiresthe Microsoft 365 tenant name. We recommend that you always save the fingerprint of newcertificates.In this example, 0C202737F8B809FAFA532C61E878F8DEEB385787 was used for Z3 and 2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974 was used for Z4. Since Z4 is required for appregistration in Microsoft 365, you need to export it as CER file without private key:If you want to use the same certificate for the ELO XC web host</s> 
<s>and the app registration (Z3=Z4),generate the certificate with two values for DnsName.In this case, you would need a new fingerprint (here: 9428F14E2E9A50DEC74D8EFD9D95DB5C3602F38D).You can check the DNS name in the local certificate store:$cert = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath C:\XcAppReg.cer9 ELO XCInstall module for Exchange Online The PowerShell examples assume that the user has administrative privileges. Run PowerShell asadministrator. Use at least PowerShell version 5.1. If necessary, update the local PowerShellversion.This is how to check the local PowerShell version:Most cmdlets require external calls. In particular, the connection to Exchange Online must beenabled for remote PowerShell access. To install missing modules and the PackageProvider, youmay be required to change the TSL version:$PSVersionTable::SecurityProtocol = ::Tls12[Net.ServicePointManager] [Net.SecurityProtocolType]10 ELO XCTo allow remote PowerShell access, you need to enable this function:You should only run signed external cmdlets and scripts. You need to confirm the start of theexecution manually:First, you can check whether the Exchange Online module (ExchangeOnlineManagement module) isavailable locally:If it is missing, you must download and install it. First install the PackageProvider for NuGet andimport it. Afterwards, you need the PowerShellGet module.This is how to install and import the PackageProvider:Enable-PSRemotingSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSignedGet-ModuleInstall-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -ForceImport-PackageProvider -Name NuGet11 ELO XCThis is how to install the PowerShellGet module:Now you can install and import the module for Exchange Online:Install-Module PowershellGet -ForceInstall-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope AllUsersImport-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement12 ELO XCPlease noteThe module for Exchange Online must be installed for all users, because the ELO XC serviceis usually registered with its own account or the system account, but the module is installedwith a different account.Test module for Exchange OnlineIf the module for Exchange Online is installed, ELO XC imports it automatically at runtime. If theimport is successful, the connection to Exchange Online can be established. Once you have set upthe app registration, you can test the PowerShell connection manually. Use the app ID and thetenant from the registration:Connect-ExchangeOnline -CertificateThumbPrint 2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974 -Organization 13 ELO XCOnce the connection is successfully established, you can test the two required Get-Mailbox and Get-MailboxPermission cmdlets:You should disconnect active PowerShell connections at the end as follows:To prevent ELO XC from accessing specific mailboxes through the PowerShell connection, you canuse New-ApplicationAccessPolicy. This requires an active PowerShell connection:Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails 'sharedmailbox' * | Get-MailboxPermission | where {$_.userDisconnect-ExchangeOnlineNew-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId cbfafa12-36c7-4586-a9c7-f94e923f1d26 -PolicyScopeGroupId xc2@tenant14 ELO XCPlease noteAfter a successful test, the Exchange Online module may fail to load in some environments.If you check the MainCatalog log, you will see a message that the Connect-ExchangeOnlinecmdlet cannot be found. In this case, you should install Microsoft PowerShell 7 in addition toMicrosoft PowerShell 5. Install the module there again.EAC: ApplicationImpersonation In an on-premises installation, ELO XC requires the ApplicationImpersonation role. This role allowsthe service account (XCACC) to impersonate access to mailboxes. The role needs to be assigned inEAC (Exchange Admin Center).15 ELO XCApp registration To allow ELO XC to connect to Microsoft 365 with Modern Authentication (OAuth 2.0), an appregistration in the tenant (TNNT) is required, which administratively acts as the service principal ofELO XC and is assigned the Exchange administrator role.

A success message isdisplayed in the dialog box.If you select Finish at this point of the registration, you will get an empty instance configurationthat you have to configure before it can be used.If you continue by clicking Next, you can create a standard, fully configured and executableinstance in the following steps. First, you need to select a catalog type:â€¢ 13 ELO XCFor on-premises Exchange servers, choose the ldap type.If you want to process mailboxes in the Microsoft Cloud, you need m365.You must run a catalog test for the connection parameters to be accepted.

Include a scheduled pause in processing if required.Create mailbox lists: When you create mailbox lists, all cataloged mailboxes are included in listtemplates and assigned to action trees.Standard archiving: With the Standard archiving option, a simple action tree for processing usermailboxes is created.Standard deletion: The Standard deletion option allows you to create an action tree for deletingstored messages.Journal archiving, journal deletion: Action trees for processing journal mailboxes can be generatedin the same way as for the Standard archiving/Standard deletion option.Archiving age, deletion age: The Archiving age and Deletion age options determine the minimumage of messages so that they can be selected respectively by the Archive and Delete action trees.Select Finish to generate the configuration.Afterwards, the newly registered instance appears in the overview.The instance state is automatically Load error for newly created instances. This means that theservice configuration could not be loaded because the new instance configuration is in theworkspace and must be published before it can be put into operation.16 ELO XCPublish configuration If there are differences between the service configuration and the working version in the manager,the instance state is marked as unpublished.To activate a working version, it must be published. If the instance was started, you need to stop itbefore you can publish the configuration. You cannot change the configuration of a service once it isrunning.Publish allows you to commit the working version to the service. Once it is successfully published,the unpublished status tag disappears.Change registration With the ELO logon option, you can change the account used for registration at any time. However,keep in mind that the account must always be one that has main administrator privileges.Delete registration If you no longer need an instance, you can use Delete to remove</s>

Click the instance stopped button.Depending on the selected mailbox catalog, the instance can take a few moments to start. Astarted instance in wait mode is marked with the started status.A started instance that is currently executing a job is marked with the processing status.If you click the button when the instance is started, the instance will be stopped at the nextpossible time. This process may take a few moments depending on the current instance activity.You can view the processing status of an active instance (processing state) at any time. Open theprocessing statistics with this button:Processing statistics The processing statistics are divided into two parts. The first part can be opened as a shortoverview below each instance.The values are valid as long as an instance is active. They are displayed as cumulative values. Thecurrent values are determined from the job that is currently running. At the end of the job, they areadded to the total values.The total statistics are stored as a collection of documents in the ELO repository under //Administration//XC Base//STATS//<instance name> and are updated by each job.By clicking on Overall statistics, you can view the recorded values. The values recorded for jobs aregrouped into days, months, and years. Completed units are always grouped into the next largerunit. The jobs of a single day are grouped into daily statistics. When all daily statistics in a monthare completed (because a new month has started), these daily statistics are grouped into monthlystatistics. When a new year starts, all monthly statistics are combined into the annual statistics of18 ELO XCthe previous year.

They can be accessed from the tools menu.Service settings You can change the values of the ELOxc.xml in the Service settings dialog box.InformationIn most cases, you will need to restart ELO XC for the changes to take effect.21 ELO XCHTTPS port, Host name: Host name and HTTPS port determine the base URL of ELO XC.Log directory, Log age, Log detail: Log directory, Log age, and Log detail determine the</s> 
<s>logsettings.Certificate or PFX file path/PFX password: Certificate or PFX file path/PFX password configurethe SSL certificate of the internal ELO XC web host.Stop timeout, Stop repeats: Stop timeout and Stop repeats can be changed if the service doesnot respond on stop attempts.Maximum number of HTTP connections, Maximum HTTP idle time [ms], Reuse HTTP ports: Maximum number of HTTP connections, Maximum HTTP idle time (milliseconds) and ReuseHTTP ports define the behavior of ELO XC when using web requests (e.g. IX, EWS). Thismainly affects the use of system resources. The higher the number and idle time of theconnections are, the longer it takes to free up system resources. It only makes sense toutilize a high amount of resources if the ports are also being reused (reducing overhead oninitialization). The default settings should deliver stable, efficient results in mostenvironments.GC age [s]: GC age (seconds) specifies the maximum wait time before ELO XC frees uporphaned memory segments (garbage collection).Mailbox registrations: Mailbox registrations can optionally be used if mailbox owners want toindependently configure mailbox data for the list of static connections.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 22 ELO XCLanguage, Tree node height, Maximum idle time [s], Service notifications includingprocessing errors, HTML tooltips: These parameters affect various aspects of ELO XCManager.License usage Licenses are used when messages from a mailbox/SMTP address are stored in the ELO repository.The total number of all licenses used is known as license usage.You can use filters to narrow down long lists. The filter is a regex search pattern.The program records for each ID/mailbox address when the license was first used and when it wasused last. If no new messages are stored for a longer period, a date on which the license can befreed up may be displayed.Log analysis This tool allows you to summarize and subsequently evaluate ELO XC logs. The results are writtento the _Summaries child folder of the log directory.Start date, End date: Start date and End date determine the time frame of the summary. Itonly takes includes log outputs with timestamps in this interval. Since all log times are inUTC, both search parameters must also be entered accordingly.Threshold: The threshold can be used as an optional restriction for values greater than 0 toonly extract lines whose duration is higher than the entered number of milliseconds.Instance: The Instance parameter can be used for values other than * to restrict the summaryto the logs of a specific instance.Create: This function calls the separate ELOxcLS.exe program, which processes the currentlyavailable logs based on the selected parameters. This process depends on the number of logfiles and the specified time interval so it may take some time.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 23 ELO XCReload: The Reload option reloads the available summaries in _Summaries and displaysthem.You can open this area to view the package contents.Download viewer: To view the summary details, you need to use the log viewer and install itlocally.

<s>install NET6. This windowopens:â€¢ 24 ELO XCIn order to be able to view the summaries, the directory of the summaries must be enteredinto the parameter directory. Afterwards, the available summaries appear under Summaries.Service log type, Instance log type, Job log type: Service, Instance, and Job log type areadditional filters for specific log types.Start at and End at: Start at and End at can be used to define the analysis period.Log level: Log level is the type of log message.Framework: The Framework option can be enabled to view Kestrel messages.Scope: The log scope is an internal designation and helps to locate the log message. If youdo not want to filter by a specific scope, you can leave the field blank.Log message: The log message contains information about the current execution position. Ifyou do not want to filter by a term in the log messages, you can leave the field blank.Stop: Logs of bulk jobs can grow to several MB in size. In such cases, it can take a while forthe information to load. You can cancel these operations with Stop.Filter: By clicking Filter, all log lines with the specified filter settings are displayed. Exampleswith and without filters:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 25 ELO XCParameter help ELO XC Manager provides tooltips for most places in the interface.26 ELO XCFor example, if you move the mouse pointer over the Catalog type parameter name in the instanceconfiguration, you will see the corresponding tooltip for this parameter. This view corresponds tothe default settings of the browser.You can have the tooltips displayed as HTML instead. Open the Service settings dialog box in thetools menu and check the HTML tooltips box.This option improves the readability of tooltips.However, the HTML view of tooltips requires additional internal JavaScript calls between thebrowser and ELO XC, which may also prove to be a disadvantage depending on the browser.27 ELO XCYou get all tooltips of the current parameters directly above the form view.Clicking the button opens the parameter help in a new browser tab.You get the full, structured description of the instance configuration fragment (technical name: InstanceDef). In addition, the associated XML schemas of the fragment are displayed after theparameter descriptions. The technical names of parameters are marked blue.28 ELO XCSuppose that you don't remember where to find a parameter but only know that it had somethingto do with the term mailbox. In this case, you can search the tooltips using the Parameter helpfunction in the tools menu.Open the Parameter help dialog box, enter mailbox, and click search.You get a list of all occurrences of the term mailbox.You decide to use the fragment CommitDef and want to read the corresponding parameter help.Click the question mark icon at the beginning of the line.The parameter help page opens again in a new browser tab.Each occurrence of the term mailbox is highlighted.Connection test The connection test is the tool you should use to test the connection parameters of an instance ifcreating an ldap or m365 catalog automatically.29 ELO XC1 Connection parameters: The</s> 
<s>top part of the dialog box contains the connection parameters thatare used for both the mailbox catalog and the EWS connection.2 Catalog test options3 EWS test optionsClicking on the Catalog test or EWS test button displays the respective results. A list of foundmailboxes is returned for the catalog tests and the connection log is displayed for the EWS tests.If you open this tool while configuring the instance for ldap or m365, it is initialized with the currentparameters. You can apply changes to the configuration by clicking Save.30 ELO XCIMAP test Similar to the test for automatic catalogs, the IMAP test enables you to check whether ELO XC canconnect to an IMAP mailbox.If you open this tool from a corresponding instance configuration, it is initialized with the availableparameters. After the test is completed, you can apply customized parameters to the instanceconfiguration with Save.Please noteOnly the first entry from the list of static connections is tested.31 ELO XCProperties The Properties tool helps you to find properties for processing messages. If you don't enter a name,all properties are displayed. However, you will usually search for specific terms and ranges.If you want to include senders in the metadata, you can search for sender.The returned list of defined Exchange properties is too large and contains irrelevant properties (see Basics > Properties chapter).32 ELO XCThe relevant properties are defined by ELO XC and are located at the end of the list of hits.Restricting the property range would show the hits immediately.When you are using property editors, it is possible that only MAPI names are available, which arenot automatically recognized by ELO XC.33 ELO XCRegex 1 Matching pattern2 Replacement3 XML-compatible view of search and replace patterns4 Options5 Example with comment6 Text entry7 Result after replacement8 Results of the search34 ELO XCClasses The Classes tool displays the set of supported message classes. The class filters enable you tosearch for specific classes. If you leave this field empty, all available classes are displayed.Mailbox usage The current mailbox usage is displayed in a dialog box. For this to work, the mailbox catalog musthave been loaded at least once in the active instance configuration. This is done with the Loadmailbox catalog function or automatically while validating the configuration.35 ELO XCYou can also use wildcards as display filters. If you want to see all mailboxes used in an action treethat has archive in the name, for example, you can use the Archive parameter.36 ELO XCDisplayed mailboxes can also be added to a mailbox template.Static mailbox registration Manually created mailbox catalogs are static since the associated connection data is notautomatically determined and is therefore unchangeable. This also means that access credentialsmust be entered manually, which is acceptable for functional mailboxes such as a premiumjournal. As soon as personal mailboxes have to be configured statically, security-relevant data canbe compromised, since mailbox owners are usually not the people who manage ELO XC.In this section, we will show you how mailbox owners can enter the connection details for their ownmailboxes in ELO XC.This function is optionally</s> 
<s>enabled with a service parameter. You can use the service settings in thetools menu for this.Alternatively, you can set the StaticBoxReg property to true in the ConfServiceDef part of the ELOxc.xml file. If this option is changed, you need to restart ELO XC for the changes to take effect.Mailbox owners can use the function via the URL http://xc-host.domain:port/statreg.SMTP address: The email address mailbox owners enter as the SMTP address.Authentication: The authentication name is authentication.Key: The password is key.As soon as you click Register, ELO XC transfers the connection data to the ELOxcBoxReg.xml file inthe installation directory.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 37 ELO XCIn our example we use two instances, one for a local Exchange server, and one for an IMAP server.Once we have registered both mailboxes, their entries can be found in ELOxcBoxReg.xml.The ELO XC administrator can now transfer this connection data to an instance configuration.We now transfer the local mailbox to the local Exchange server instance.38 ELO XCClick Apply to transfer the connection data to the list of static mailboxes.Next, switch to the IMAP server instance and open the mailbox registrations window again.Now you can select the IMAP mailbox and transfer it to the list of static connections.The local mailbox is still listed in the mailbox registrations even though already transferred thedata. This is because you have the option to repeat the process for any number of instances. If youare sure that you no longer need the data, you can delete the entry.InformationThe registration process can be repeated for an SMTP address at any time. ELO XCrecognizes the registered connections by address and updates authentication names orpasswords in both the ELOxcBoxReg.xml file and the instance configuration as required.39 ELO XC Table of contents Operation ELO XC Manager Overview Authentication Menu Service notifications 'User' drop-down menu 'Tools' drop-down menu Instance overview Instance configuration Configuration functions Configuration structure Tree functions Form functions Display functions Instance overview Register instance Publish configuration Change registration Delete registration Start/stop instance Processing statistics Tools Service settings License usage Log analysis Parameter help Connection test IMAP test Properties Regex Classes Mailbox usage Static mailbox registration</s>

If log files arenot written immediately when the service starts, there are two possible reasons for this:The file ELOxc.xml is configured incorrectlyThe ELO XC account does not have write permissions on the log directoryFor performance reasons, the logs are separated and not stored in a log file.Settings You configure the log settings in the ELOxc.xml file.LogDir: LogDir is where ELO XC stores the log directory tree. It also contains the Windows servicelog as well as the ELO XC Manager user interface log.LogAge: You can specify the retention period for logs here. The default value 0 ignores the log age.Other values, i.e. greater than 0, are interpreted as the maximum log age in days up to a maximumof 365. Once logs reach the configured maximum age, they are automatically deleted.LogDetail: The log files in ELO XC do not have settings like debug or info. Instead, granular loggingis applied, i.e. the log level (LogDetail) accepts values from 0 to 20. The higher the value, the moredetailed the log is. The value 0 means no logs are created.Please noteIf you have enabled automatic deletion of old logs, use a different path for the log directorythan the one used for the installation directory. The deletion routine deletes all files in theconfigured log directory, regardless of whether they are actually logs or not.Log lines The log is created line by line at runtime. The time, part of the program, type of message, and a logmessage are recorded.â€¢ â€¢ <!-- the directory all ELO XC logs are written to -->< attribute name="LogDir" type="xs:string" "optional" default="C:\Temp"/><!-- maximum log file age as number of days -->< attribute name="LogAge" type="xs:int" use="optional" default="0" /><!-- maximum log detail -->< attribute name="LogDetail" type="xs:int" use="optional" default="20" />xs: use:xs:xs:3 ELO XC1 Timestamp: All timestamps are in universal (time zone independent) time to make it easier tocompare data with other programs if you have distributed applications. The three-part structureconsists of date, universal time, and milliseconds.2 Execution path: Logs are assigned to internal execution paths.3 Program version: When a log is started, information about the executed ELO XC program versionis recorded.4 Marker: Log messages have different markers depending on their type. The following markers canappear:[i] â€“ Information is the most common type of log output, and hence the default type.[w] â€“ Warnings appear rarely. They are indications that something is not working properly,but are not a reason to terminate the program.[e] â€“ You should normally pay attention to regular errors. Most errors need to be fixed toensure that the program works properly. This message type is always recorded regardless ofthe logging level.[F] â€“ Fatal errors are recorded when there is a risk that processing may fail immediately orhas</s> 
<s>already failed at another point. In such cases, processing is usually aborted immediately.This message type is always recorded regardless of the logging level.[x] â€“ External log lines from the Microsoft framework or certain Microsoft components mayoccasionally appear, provided that the respective assemblies automatically support the ELOXC log.5 Log message: Log messages consist of a block (or context) and the actual message. The enablesyou to easily identify the process or part of the program affected, while the message reflects thecurrent processing point.InformationThe standard way to check log files manually is to search for error markers. With [e] or [F],you can quickly find the relevant parts, even in more extensive logs.Individual log outputs A directory with the same name is created for each instance. This is where the main log, catalogrequests, job directories, and job ZIPs are stored.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 4 ELO XCThe following log outputs are written:Identifier Validity MeaningSrv ServiceThis file contains everything the process does on its own, such as start,basic structure, basic functions, top-level information,UnhandledExceptionCatcher.Wks ServiceThis log contains logs for functions that are triggered interactively (ELO XCManager).Main InstanceThis log relates to the instance configuration (e.g. parameter warnings,automatic version updates, license count). It also contains information as towhy a configuration may not be viable. If the configuration is valid, theinstance starts and logs the job starts.MainCatalog InstanceThis log contains catalog queries via LDAP or PowerShell. It contains a log ofconnection issues during creation of a catalog and the list of selectedmailboxes.JobControl JobThis file contains information about the job controller. It logs the mailboxregistrations, item selections, and worker control.JobCatalog JobThis file corresponds to MainCatalog, but is created by JobControl at jobstart.Worker JobEach worker writes its own log. It logs the processing of the items that areselected by the job controller and transferred to workers.JobErrors JobThis log lists all items for which an action tree returns the not successfulresult.Summary UserThese files contain log summaries created interactively. They are written tothe <LogDir>_Summaries child folder and can be opened withLogViewer.exe.Please noteThe global Trace option ensures that all http network traffic from the EWS interface is loggedin addition to the logs written by ELO XC. This option generates extensive logs and shouldtherefore only be used in exceptions or after consulting product support.Isolation Isolating relevant logs is important in a production system since there may be a large number oflogs depending on the specified maximum log age. When a problem is reproducible, logs can helpyou to understand the problem. You have two options to isolate relevant parts of the log andcompile important logs:Manual compilationAutomatic compilationâ€¢ â€¢ 5 ELO XCManual compilation The manual method is useful if ELO XC Manager is unavailable and you do not have the option tocompile logs automatically.

These tools give youadvanced insight into internal and often hidden message data. However, these tools are notavailable in every situation and environment. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of the toolsare not even required because only property values need to be displayed, and you can use Outlooktools for this.In this example, you can see how the message class PidTagMessageClass and the ELO GUID EloXcArchivedExt of an archived message can be displayed.Start Microsoft Outlook.Select the Preview view.Right-click to open the context menu.Select View Settings.In the Advanced View Settings dialog box, you can edit the columns.Click Columns...The available columns are grouped differently.

To be able to select it, you need to switch to the All Mail fieldsgroup.12 ELO XCSelect Message Class and click Add.To add the ELO XC archiving status, you need to select the User-defined fields in Inbox group.Since the property is created by ELO XC and Outlook has no information about it, you nowneed to create a new column.Click New Column.13 ELO XCEnter EloXcArchivedExt as the name with the type and format Text and confirm with OK.Once you have closed the Advanced View Settings, you will see Message class and EloXcArchivedExt in your view.10. 14 ELO XCVery large messages Message size limits allow you to specify the size of messages a user is allowed to send andreceive. When a mailbox is created, there is no default size limit for sending and receivingmessages.In this best practice tip, we show you how to configure size limits in Microsoft Exchange and in theEWS interface.Exchange Set the</s> 
<s>message size limits using the Exchange Management Console.InformationRefer to this Microsoft documentation when configuring message size limits in MicrosoftExchange.In the following example, the maximum size of sent messages for Debra Garcia's mailbox is set to25 MB, and to 35 MB for received messages. Enter the cmdlet in the Exchange ManagementConsole PowerShell.To verify that the settings were successfully applied, run the following command in the ExchangeManagement Console PowerShell:EWS To configure the message size in Exchange Web Services (EWS), run the Microsoft IIS web server.You need to set the maxAllowedContentLength parameter in various IIS web server web.config files.InformationYou can find more information in this Microsoft documentation and on the CodeTwo website.Set-Mailbox -Identity "Debra Garcia" -MaxSendSize 25mb -MaxReceiveSize 35mbGet-Mailbox -Identity <Identity> | Format-List MaxSendSize,MaxReceiveSize15 ELO XChttps://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/exchange/recipients/user-mailboxes/mailbox-message-size-limits?view=exchserver-2019https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/exchange/recipients/user-mailboxes/mailbox-message-size-limits?view=exchserver-2019https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/exchange/architecture/client-access/client-message-size-limits?view=exchserver-2019https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/exchange/architecture/client-access/client-message-size-limits?view=exchserver-2019https://www.codetwo.com/kb/changing-the-message-size-limithttps://www.codetwo.com/kb/changing-the-message-size-limitCatalog test with PowerShell The following section contains some examples of how to use the Catalog test tool to apply filtersfor the m365 catalog type.

All mailboxes of the group XCTestGroup365 appear.19 ELO XCOutlook categories In this example, we show you how to use Outlook categories in combination with ELO XC to tagdifferent processing states.Since the icons in Outlook are bound to message classes, ELO XC does without this option to tagprocessing states. Instead, we recommend setting a tag for the mailbox owners by subject.However, in cases where you don't want to use this, it is also possible to tag e-mails with anOutlook category.Optionally, you can specify the Outlook category when executing the Archive action.If the messages are archived without tagging the subject, the following occurs:The status tag is always set internally using a property. However, the visual representation of thetag is now also different. ELO XC does not define a color category. It is either assigned randomly or20 ELO XCinitially left empty.</s> 
<s>Once it has been selected by the mailbox owner, it is retained for the categoryname ELO going forward:Since Outlook categories are suitable for item states, you can also use them in conjunction withstatus tags set by properties:If you add this action to the action tree before saving and then file a new message, you will get thefollowing view:21 ELO XCSelect your own color for this category as well:For our example, we assume that after the initial archiving, another action tree will process onlythose messages that were initially archived. In this case, the action tree would get this addition inthe selection restrictions:22 ELO XCThe previously set status tag is used with the automatically generated property EloInitialExt toselect messages. This works for any archiving state, i.e. even for non-archived messages or thosethat are not assigned to an Outlook category. If you only want to make a selection by Outlookcategory, use the Keywords property.23 ELO XCIn this case, however, it is not enough to just select an Outlook category. The category name is alsoimportant and should be called Initial. As a result, the action tree selects only archived messageswhich are assigned to an Outlook category named Initial.The tree in this example removes this Outlook category and sets a new category called Done. Thisrequires the Tag action again.After the action tree has processed the messages, the category changes:24 ELO XCFor our example, we assume that mailbox owners first categorize their messages with Initial beforethey are allowed to be processed by ELO XC. We also assume that ELO XC assigns these messagesto the Done category after they are stored.You now need an action tree that selects non-archived messages from the Initial category. To dothis, you need to set the archiving status to no in the above example. The selection restriction tothe Outlook category Initial remains unchanged.25 ELO XCFor this example, you can use the generated default configuration. Create copies of the Subtree Arcand Simple Archiving action trees. Give the copies names that allow you to identify their purpose.The active action tree is assigned the selection restriction according to the Initial category. In the Set Marker action, the subtree should change the category of the message to Done instead of thesubject. The Archive action does not use an Outlook category.26 ELO XCThe matching pattern must be chosen so that it recognizes the category name as part of a CSV listand does not change the other category names in this list. This is necessary because Outlookcategories belong to the list types. These types are generally not supported by ELO XC. Therefore,the categories are kept internally as a CSV list during processing.After the new action tree has processed the messages, the message is displayed as follows:27 ELO XC28 ELO XCEJ ELO XCAll Unread1!

The resulting selections are the messages that aresubsequently processed by the action tree.The examples and explanations build on each other. This way, if you repeat examples at somepoint, you will find it easier to get started.In addition to ELO XC, you will need Outlook and a mailbox for creating the test messages. Theexamples can be used for on-premises Exchange servers and Microsoft 365 Exchange Online. Werecommend working with an on-premises Exchange server, as this is reduces the processing timeby a factor of 25-50, which is useful considering that you have to start jobs again in a number ofthe examples.We only use one action tree, e.g. the Simple Archiving tree that was generated on automaticinstance creation. We make changes to the tree as we go along. If you already have experiencewith ELO XC and have created several action trees yourself, you can reproduce these examples inone of your test instances with your own action trees. All you need to do is take note of theparameters in the action tree.29 ELO XCFirst, delete all list templates and configure only the user mailbox you are going to use.Set the minimum age to 000:00:00:01 so that you can do the tests without having to wait. If youneed other minimum ages, we show you how to configure this in the examples. Entry templates,folder filters, and message classes remain unchanged. The examples do not use folder filters, andwith a few exceptions towards the end of this course, you will only create simple, small e-mails inthe inbox.30 ELO XCNow change the ArcPath filing path action to make it easier to find the results in the repository. Weuse the main folder Selection restrictions in this example.The examples of the different selection criteria are divided into subsections. You could also changethe storage path in the repository for each section to get all the results afterwards. However, theexamples are easier and quicker to reproduce if you don't do this.Now go back to the Simple Archiving action tree and change the name to Selections, for example.Save your changes.Required restrictions There are different ways to apply selection restrictions to action trees. The selection of mailboxesin itself is a type of selection restriction. Messages from mailboxes that are not configured for anaction tree are not processed, which definitely constitutes a message selection restriction.Entry points and folder filters allow you to include and exclude different mailbox folders. This isalso a restriction because only messages are selected from allowed mailbox folders.Message class selection is also a restriction because it allows you to separate folder items by themessage class.31 ELO XCLet's assume you only want to process standard e-mails in the inbox or underlying folders. You onlyneed an entry point and the message class IPM.Note (standard e-mails).Now save the instance configuration</s> 
<s>and validate it. There should be no validation errors. Go backto the instance overview and publish your new configuration. The unpublished tag should havedisappeared. You will use the Change, Save, Validate, and Publish steps frequently in this section.We will assume that you do this independently so that we can focus entirely on the examples.Archiving status Now create any e-mail you like:32 ELO XCStart the instance. After a few moments, you should be able to see the new e-mail in the repository.You will also notice that the subject in the ELO XC mailbox has been changed:As you try out the examples in this section, you will repeatedly make minor changes to and publishthe configuration, create a new e-mail, process it, and then see changes in the mailbox andrepository. We recommend that you review the results once processing is complete.The section mainly covers selection restrictions without property restrictions. The latter allows youto apply custom properties, another important part of message selection, but in this case we onlygo into detail on the standard selection criteria without custom extensions:33 ELO XCYou have already used the archiving status. although it occurred automatically. It is set to no, whichmeans that ELO XC will only process messages that have not yet been archived, i.e. stored in therepository. Now start the instance again and check if the Select 1 message is stored. It should showup as a duplicate in the repository, but that doesn't happen because the archiving status preventsthat from happening. You can now repeat the process as often as you like without Select 1 beingprocessed again.This is because the message was assigned an internal tag, known as the archiving status, the firsttime it was processed. This is how ELO XC marks elements that have already been processed, i.e.stored in the repository. This corresponds to the vast majority of all use cases, since messageduplicates are not usually required. However, you can store the message a second time if needed.Change the archiving status to yes. After saving, validating, and publishing, run the instance again.34 ELO XCThe message shows up in the repository a second time and is marked as a duplicate in themailbox.Of course, changing the archiving status to yes in the selection restrictions ensures that only thosemessages that already have the archiving identifier are now selected for processing. The fact thatthe selected message shows up in the repository is due to the fact that ELO XC always processescurrently valid items. If a message has a subject tag during processing, it is filed with that subject.Tagging it again means that it is duplicated in the mailbox. Later you will learn to tag messagesdifferently, but the default behavior is sufficient for this case.Change the archiving status to ignore. What effect will this have? And how would you go aboutchecking this?You need a second message that has not been archived yet. Create an e-mail with the subject Select 2 and start processing. Did you expect what happened? You can reproduce this example onyour own before reading on.You should get the</s> 
<s>following result:35 ELO XCThe messages are processed regardless of their archiving status, both the new message Select 2,which currently has no archiving identifier, as well as Select 1, which has already been processedtwice.Delete the stored copies of Select 1 and Select 2 in the repository and mailbox.InformationFor all other selection examples, we use only the ignore status in this section. In practice,this is rarely necessary, but usually only when checks, categorizations, or deletions areneeded regardless of archiving status and without filing the items. For our examples, on theother hand, it is useful to select this status as it means we do not have to recreate testmessages with each processing run. We accept that there are duplicates in this case.Size restrictions Pick three attachments (e.g., small images or PDF files) with significantly varying file sizes. Attachthe smallest one to the Small message, the medium-sized attachment to the Medium message,and the largest one to the Large message. You should see the following messages in Outlook:36 ELO XCLet us assume that you want to process the medium-sized message with a size restriction. Howwould you go about it? Take a quick look at the selection criteria (1 kilobyte is approximately 1000bytes).The messages can be filtered by their total size (all message parts, including file attachments).To process the medium-sized message in the example shown, a minimum size of 300000 bytesand a maximum size of 400000 bytes is sufficient. You need to determine the size of your medium-sized message in Outlook. The following applies for our example:37 ELO XCAfter processing, your Medium message should have a tag and the original should be in therepository. Is this the case?Now find a size limit so that all messages except Large are processed. Keep in mind that in a real-life scenario, this could affect a lot of e-mails. How would you select the limit if you assume thatyou currently see only the three most recent messages in your mailbox, but in fact there are manyother messages that this size limit should apply to?Since there can be any number of messages smaller than Large, and also very small ones, thelower limit is set to 0. In the mailbox, you can see that Medium has been processed again, which iswhat we had intended:Repeat the test with a configuration that now processes all messages except Small. Of course, younow already know what result to expect. As you can see, this is also the result you get.38 ELO XCInformationYou have to assume that even minor changes to the configuration do not always have anoticeable effect. ELO XC offers you a total of about 500 configuration parameters forindividually processing and storing messages. Many of these parameters are rarely usedand are useful only in certain cases. Therefore, you cannot expect to know all parametersand to predict their effect in every case, but you can always check how they work. As youprogress in ELO XC, you will learn which changes you need to check and which you canassume will function.In the last configuration, did you consider</s> 
<s>that there might be messages even bigger than Large?The configuration should be approximately like this:Above Small is the minimum size of the selection. With a maximum size of 0, the upper limit isignored or not used. In this case, all messages that are larger than the minimum size are selected.Clean up your mailbox again as well as the repository. Remember to set the size limit back to 0.Attachments The parameter values ignore, no, and yes are used several times in the selection restrictions, e.g.also for the selection restriction by attachment.39 ELO XCNow create these three e-mails:Without attachment should not have any attachments.Inline attachment should not contain an attachment, but an embedded image. You can copyand paste any image you like into the body of the message. Add a small text below theimage.While you are creating Attachment, drag and drop a file into the attachments.You now have these three e-mails in the inbox:Process these messages with attachments set to ignore. The result is:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 40 ELO XCIf you now change the restrictions so that ELO XC cannot select messages with attachments, whatresult do you think you would get? Try it for yourself.The messages with the embedded image/inline attachment are selected because they do not havean attachment. This makes sense because when attachments are extracted with the Export actionand stored separately from the message, the message body is retained. Inline attachments areinterpreted as part of the written message.Change the restriction for attachments to yes and start processing again. You will now see that the Attachment e-mail has been processed a second time.Sensitivity level Now create a new Normal message. Select the Options in Outlook.41 ELO XCOpen the Properties and select the Sensitivity settings.Create a message for each of these sensitivity levels You should now have four new messages inyour mailbox:Information42 ELO XCIf you have created four messages according to the instructions and still only see threebecause Private is missing, it is not because you have made a mistake. The reason isprobably that you are using an Outlook profile with multiple mailboxes and only one accountwas used to log on. The account that is used to log on is allowed to access other mailboxesby proxy. If you sent the messages from the mailbox of the logged in account (Outlookstandard for new items), you will find all four messages in Sent items of the correspondingmailbox, while only three are visible in the inbox of the recipient mailbox. This mailbox isassociated with another user account and therefore does not reveal its private messages toother accounts.The sensitivity level selection restrictions:The available options are Normal, Personal, Private, or Confidential. ELO XC allows all sensitivitylevels by default. If a level is disabled, messages with this sensitivity level are not selected.We now want to process only personal messages:43 ELO XCWe can expect this result in the mailbox:Take your time and test the other sensitivity levels, or different combinations of these levels. Whenyou have finished, you need to clean up Outlook and the repository again and remove theconfidentiality level</s> 
<s>restriction in the action tree.Read or unread? You are probably already familiar with the option to mark messages as Unread after reading. Thisfunction is a simple way to create a reminder. But are you also aware of the trick that tells you amessage has already been read at least once even though it has been marked as Unread?You can configure this distinction with the Read flag in the selection restriction.44 ELO XCWhen you are testing this, you need to be careful about how many clicks you make as otherwiseyou will have to do the test again. This is due to the behavior in Outlook. As soon as a message hasbeen selected once, the Read flag is set and saved when you select another message in Outlook.However, the EverRead flag is also set. If you reset the status to Unread, only the Read flag isremoved. EverRead is never reset.This is how Exchange keeps track of whether a mailbox owner has noticed a message at leastonce. The user-side function to reset Read has a counter function on the server side, EverRead.For this example, you need the following messages in the mailbox. Before you start, read theinstructions below.45 ELO XC0 and 1 indicate whether the respective flag is set. Create read=1, ever=1.After the message is delivered, select it and leave it selected.Now create read=0, ever=0 and read=0, ever=1.Next, select read=0, ever=1 and then read=1, ever=1.Since read=0, ever=1 is now marked as Read, set the status back to Unread.Finally, select read=1, ever=1 again.From this point, do not select any of the messages until your tests are complete, as it could corruptyour test data.InformationThere is no need to consider the combination of Read and EverRead, as it cannot occur.Therefore, the configuration Read=yes and EverRead=no throws a validation error.The following table shows which messages should be selected and stored in your tests. Testthe combinations for Read and EverRead.Read EverRead read=0, ever=1 read=0, ever=0 read=1, ever=1ignore ignore X X Xno ignore X Xyes ignore Xignore no Xno no Xignore yes X Xno yes Xyes yes XInformation46 ELO XCThe read status is an important property of e-mails. Since ELO XC works independently ofmailbox owners, it is possible to make settings that ensure that mailbox owners never seemessages because ELO XC has already stored them in the repository and removed themfrom the mailbox before the mailbox owners access their mailbox again. You shouldconsider this if mailbox owners are unable to read their e-mails for a longer period (e.g.because of vacation). In a journal mailbox, however, message selection based on the readstatus would be an obstacle.Body format Most e-mail clients support text format and HTML format. Outlook additionally supports RTF,although this format is outdated.Create one message each with the subject HTML, TEXT, and RTF and use the appropriate format:While you are creating the messages, you can still copy a short text into the message body andadd text formatting (e.g. bold, italic, text color, text size). Of course, this does not work in text-onlyformat.These messages are used for your next selection</s> 
<s>test:Use the following selection restrictions:47 ELO XCNow select yes for text format and no for the other two formats. Test whether the correct messageis processed:If you use actions that read out the message body, the selection criteria for the body format can berelevant. The Match/Replace action in particular requires messages to have a specific body formatif it is to correctly process them. The body is also just a message property whose value is theunformatted text content of the body.48 ELO XCLet us take a simple body, Hello XC!, which has been formatted a little for better visualization. Thebody stored internally is much bigger, although it is not shown in full here. We will only show youthe HTML body:Based on this example, you can see that it is very important to know the body format in order toconfigure actions for match actions or even replace actions.InformationHTML is the default message body format in Outlook. You can adjust this setting in theMicrosoft Outlook options. We do not recommend using Rich Test Format (RTF). HTMLprovides the same formatting options as RTF and is much more widespread. If you use RTF,Outlook always attempts to store a version of the message body as HTML. However, thismay result in server-side latencies.Before you continue with the next example, set all selection restrictions for the message bodyback to ignore.Message age We haven't shown the example for setting the selection restrictions by item age until now despitethe fact that time constraints for selected items are the most important criterion. However, to dothis example, we need to consider another message class and adapt our tests somewhat.The scenario is more complex and requires more preparation and exact configuration steps. Beforereading on, create a simple e-mail with the subject Old. We will need it soon.If something goes wrong while you are testing the selection restrictions by message age, startover.<body lang="EN" link="#0563C1" vlink="#954F72" style="tab-interval:35.4pt;word-wrap:break-word" <div class="WordSection1"> <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="color:#00B050">Hello </span> <b> <span style="color:black">XC</span> </b> <span style="color:black">!< p></ p></span> </p> </div></body>o: o:49 ELO XCWe'll now explain how to use these selection criteria:The default maximum age value is a static setting. Given the current year, you are unlikely to haveany e-mails that are over 20 years old. However, you can change this value if this is the case. Thetheoretical limit is 01.01.1970. If you change the maximum age for any reason, make sure youretain the correct format.The parameter format is also important for the minimum age selection criterion. It corresponds tothe standard time format in ELO XC, i.e. days followed by hours, minutes, and seconds. As there isno default value for the minimum age, it is not automatically set when new action trees arecreated and has to be defined manually. If the minimum age is missing, the configuration cannot bevalidated.The calculation of the message age requires a reference time, which is set by ELO XC to the time ofthe job start. This creates a similar message age for all messages selected in a job by any numberof action trees. This internal timestamp of the</s> 
<s>job start is also used when setting the archivingstatus. If a message is assigned the archived status, the hidden property EloXcArchivedBase isgiven exactly this timestamp.50 ELO XCThe third minimum age property selection criterion determines which value should be used todetermine the age. Theoretically, you could use different time properties.The figure shows which time properties are used internally by Exchange or Outlook. They servedifferent purposes. However, each gets the PidTagMessageDeliveryTime property (or PRMESSAGEDELIVERY_TIME). This timestamp is created at the moment an item is delivered to theinbox and is considered received. ELO XC uses the alias sent for this property.PidTagLastModificationTime (or PRLASTMODIFICATION_TIME) can also be relevant for processing inELO XC if you only want to select messages that the mailbox owner has not changed for a specifiedduration.The PidTagEndDate time property (or PRENDDATE) is not visible in the image. This is because thisproperty is only created for calendar items that belong to a separate message class. The imageabove was created for an item of the IPM.Note class and therefore cannot contain PidTagEndDate.You can configure these three properties to determine the message age (general item age):Parameter Propertysent PidTagMessageDeliveryTimeenddate PidTagEndDatelastmodified PidTagLastModificationTimeIf more than five minutes have passed since the Old message was created, you can create anothermessage with the subject New. Afterwards, change the Minimum age restriction to 000:00:05:00and check whether the correct message is processed:51 ELO XCNow set the minimum age to 000:00:00:01 again and check whether the correct messages areprocessed:We now want to leave the minimum age at 000:00:00:01, but still exclude Old. To do this, we setthe maximum age to 2022/06/11 08:00:00 (note UTC conversion). This means it is newer than the Old e-mail. The result is:Now we change the matching property to PidTagLastModificationTime by selecting the lastmodifiedoption. The minimum age should be set to 30 seconds:The important thing is that we can get the configuration ready and start processing immediately.But first we need to change one of the two messages. Double-click the message to open and edit itand change the subject from Old to Updated.52 ELO XCYou can click on the subject line and just type Updated. You can take your time with this becauseExchange doesn't know about this change yet. After you save the change by clicking on the diskicon, you have 30 seconds to make the effect of your configuration change visible:Updated, the former Old e-mail, was not archived, even though the message is significantly olderthan New. This is exactly what we want to achieve. The minimum age of 30 seconds since the lastchange has not yet passed, which is why ELO XC did not select this message for processing.Now change the minimum age back to one second and set sent as the selection property. To besure, start processing again so that you get this result:Now we can look at the enddate (PidTagEndDate) selection. First, however, we need to give accessto calendar items (IPM.Appointment). In this case, we need to make changes to the entry pointsand allowed message classes of the action tree:53 ELO XCConfigure the instance to start</s> 
<s>immediately and clear the inbox. Now create a message with thesubject No appointment.Before you create the appointment, which we also need for the next example, you may need totake into account that when you click on the calendar, Outlook opens the associated folder of themain mailbox in the Outlook profile. If you follow the examples with another mailbox associatedwith the Outlook profile, you have to view this calendar first before you can create theappointment:If you are doing all the examples with only one mailbox anyway, and that mailbox is used to sendall the test messages, you can ignore this interim step. Now create an appointment in the calendarand set it to end 30 minutes into the future:54 ELO XCIf Outlook issues a warning that the appointment has already started, you can close the message.It is not relevant for this example. Before the 30 minutes until the end of the appointment haveelapsed, we run the next test. Change the matching property to PidTagEndDate, which only uses IPM.Appointment:You need to change the required minimum age of the selection restriction:Process the e-mails again after this change. You will notice that neither the No appointment e-mailnor the XC appointment e-mail are processed.This is because the end time of the appointment is in the future. This means that the calculatedminimum age cannot have been reached yet. In addition, standard e-mails (class IPM.Note) do nothave this property. The result is that neither the e-mail nor the appointment can be processed. Thismay seem like a disadvantage at first, but it is an important advantage when processing Outlookcalendars.Imagine that ELO XC processes thousands of appointments using only the creation date as aselection criterion for processing. Does this mean that ELO XC should archive every appointmentthat is created today and does not take place until six months from now? It quite possibly makessense. In this case, the creation date of the appointment or the arrival time of the appointment inthe mailbox is sufficient.However, if you assume that ELO XC should not only store items, but also delete them, an essentialbasic function for reducing the amount of items stored on the Exchange server, then the risk of55 ELO XClosing data would be very high. Moreover, appointments are often scheduled far into the future. Sohow what unit should we use for the minimum age of the creation date: days, weeks, months, oryears?The best way to correctly process appointments without deleting the items from the mailboxes tooearly is to wait until the appointments are over and then delete them. In most cases, it is sufficientto archive the calendar entries immediately with a designated action tree and then delete themright away. In principle, however, you still have the option to select different reference points.Process the e-mails again after the end of the appointment entry. You will now see the expectedresult in the calendar:InformationIf you configure ELO XC to process e-mails and calendar entries, it makes sense to processthe two message classes separately. Since no e-mails are selected with enddate, you cansafely assume that</s> 
<s>there will be no unwanted processing results, but this does not applyvice versa, nor does it make sense to use complex, overlapping selections. This could leadconfiguration errors and unwanted results in the long term. A higher number of action treescan noticeably increase the time it takes a job to run, but it is not always necessary toprocess items faster, especially since there are alternative measures to increaseperformance in ELO XC.Reset all selection parameters to the default values (age: 1 second, sent property) and remove themessage class IPM.Appointment as well as the entry point {%APPOINTMENT} if you want to do theexamples in this section again.Best practice In practice, selection restrictions are used to ensure that ELO XC processes the right message setand that the selection criteria are as ideal as possible. The processing time differs if only thosemessages that an action tree is actually going to process have to be fully retrieved from Exchange.In contrast, restrictions with low selectivity mean that messages that have already been(down)loaded must be discarded again by performing subsequent property matches. Usingaccurate selection criteria ensures that the Exchange server makes the selection before the56 ELO XCmessages are fully loaded and only the IDs of the relevant messages are determined. Completeitem data is retrieved based on this ID only when processing starts.Exchange server performance also depends on the total number of mailbox items being managed.Having a large number of items can cause delays. You should always configure ELO XC in morecomplex scenarios in such a way that the items are deleted from the Exchange server as early aspossible. If an instance has two action trees, one for filing and one for deleting old mailbox itemsthat have already been filed, we recommend that you run the action tree for deleting first. Thisreduces the total amount before the messages are selected, which improves performance.This improvement is already incorporated when selecting the mailbox folders to be processed bygenerally excluding folders without items from the item selection, as the item count is generallyavailable when querying available folders. Only when processing public folders do we recommendprocessing folders independent of the determined item count (see selection option Ignore itemcount), as the system may return incorrect item counts for public folders when queried and and sothese folders must be subjected to an item search in each case.You can also use the Move action to reduce the total number of messages in advance. If mailboxescontain messages that should never be processed, it is worth considering moving them to a childfolder that is ignored during message selection. However, if mailbox owners want or need todecide which messages will be processed, you could specify a child folder that will be processed onits own. You can easily do this by configuring a suitable entry point. Finally, the Tag action allowsyou to assign an internal tag to messages to ensure that ELO XC ignores them on a permanentbasis.57 ELO XCExternal calls The External call action is a good way to trigger next work steps in ELO after ELO XC has</s> 
<s>stored themessage. Here are some examples of how you can configure this in ELO XC.Registered functions Registered functions are JavaScript functions that are directly controlled by ELO XC via theIndexserver interface. They are stored in the Administration folder of the repository:In this example, the script file XC RFs.js is generated and stored in the repository. The scriptfunctions demonstrate how to handle function parameters and function returns:58 ELO XCThe RFHelloNull* and RFHelloNullReturn* functions return the same null result. RFHello*, on theother hand, returns Hello, while RFHelloArgs* attaches the first function parameter to Hello andcreates Hello Arg 0: <parameter value>.For more information about using the Indexserver interface, see: https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/en-us/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/You will find examples of registered functions at: https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/en-us/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/#example-of-a-registered-function-in-javascriptIn order for ELO XC to call the correct function, the External call action must be configuredappropriately:59 ELO XChttps://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/#beispiel-fur-eine-registrierte-funktion-in-javascripthttps://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/#beispiel-fur-eine-registrierte-funktion-in-javascripthttps://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/#beispiel-fur-eine-registrierte-funktion-in-javascripthttps://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/de-de/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/#beispiel-fur-eine-registrierte-funktion-in-javascriptThe name of the registered function has to be used as the target address. The parameters arealways passed in the order of the configured call parameters. On transfer/call, a parameter fieldcontains the value determined at runtime based on the configuration.The example configures the call for the first example function. In the worker log, you will thereforefind the result null. If XC calls RF_Hello, Hello appears in the log.The example RFHelloArgs* should show the SORD GUID of the message filed previously in the log.If you change RFHelloArgs* to use args[1], you will get the subject of the message in the loginstead of the GUID.60 ELO XCPlease noteRegistered Indexserver functions are the most flexible and comprehensive way to do post-processing after storing messages, and should therefore always be considered in suchcases. However, care should be taken to ensure that the processing time of these functionsis kept to a minimum. ELO XC processes masses of e-mails, which means that latencies ofjust a few seconds have a significant impact on the overall processing performance.Therefore, functions that quickly categorize a message and forward it to appropriate scriptsor components in ELO are recommended.ELO feeds The External call action can also be used to generate ELO feeds. The following example shows howa localized action text can be generated in the feed after storing an e-mail. This can be used tonotify users about incoming messages, for example.The localized texts must be available as properties files in the Administration folder of therepository:They define the localized action text to be displayed. The freely selectable variables/parameters ofthe message are listed numbered in curly brackets.The action configuration looks like this:61 ELO XCThe name of the properties file is the call target.The STANDARD text value named key has to be entered as the first call parameter. This entry ismandatory in order to determine the correct entry in the properties file.The other call parameters are determined at runtime and transferred in the order they areconfigured to generate the feed action. The order of the call parameters should correspond to thenumbering of the text variables.62 ELO XCWorkflows To pass a message or attachment to a workflow using an external call, you need to first create aworkflow template. To illustrate the action, a simple</s> 
<s>template is enough. We'll call it XCTEST:The name of the workflow template is used in the ELO XC configuration to create a new workflowthat is used while processing the current message.Configure a simple action tree with the actions Filing path, Export, Archive, and External call.63 ELO XCThe tree selects non-archived messages, uses the Inbox as the entry point, and only processes the IPM.Note message class. The Archive, Match/Replace (subject marker in this case), and Saveactions can be used with the general settings or changed if required. The latter two actions are notimportant for calling the workflow and are used here to make it easier to execute multiple tests oneafter the other while processing only current example messages.In order to use the filing path for messages (main documents) and attachments in different exportscenarios, you must configure a path for both document types.64 ELO XCThe path segments are not important in this example. However, they were chosen so that it iseasier to recognize which documents are stored in the repository while testing differentconfigurations. These segments are configured for both path types:In the Export action, it is evident that both file types are required. The export mode automaticallydetermines which path type should or can be used.65 ELO XCDepending on the export mode, ELO XC tries to determine/create the correct filing path while the Archive action is processing. The table shows how the correct path is determined.Export mode Path determinationwhole Only the configured main path is used.maindoconly Only the configured main path is used.attachmentsonly Only the configured attachment path is used.splitThe configured main path is used for the main document, and the configuredattachment path is used for attachments. If an attachment path was notconfigured, the configured main path is used.splitattachmentsThe configured main path is used for the main document, and the configuredattachment path is used for attachments. If an attachment path was notconfigured, the configured main path is used.The configuration of External call must take into account that the call target is a workflow and thatan existing SORD must be passed to the workflow.66 ELO XCSince the action can call different interfaces, the wf call type must be specified for the creation ofworkflows. The GUID created in the process identifies the newly created SORD (document).The Parameter name is not required for a wf call. You can define any value here. The GUID, on theother hand, can only be retrieved via the ELO property EloGuid â€“ propname specifies that theconfigured parameter is interpreted as a property name.Test this simple configuration with a short message.Publish the configuration and execute it once. This message should appear in the repository:67 ELO XCThe user of the first workflow node (in this case Administrator) should also see this workflow as atask:In the next example, store the message and an attached PDF file in separate folders in therepository. You only want to start the workflow on the PDF, however. Create a message with a PDFattachment and an image copied into the message body.68 ELO XCWhich actions would the changes to the</s> 
<s>ELO XC configuration be made in?What?The number and type of stored documents are always configured with the Export action.How?The Archive action determines how the documents are stored.Where?The Filing path action determines where the documents are stored.And after that?You could continue processing the message with the External call action or simply delete it.If you want to separate the PDF from the message, you need to configure the Export action. The split export mode extracts the attachment from the message. In this case, the message, or maindocument, is stored in the repository without attachments.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 69 ELO XCThe second change you need to make in the configuration is less obvious. It is done in the Externalcall action.The EloGuid property can only be used for the main document, i.e. the message itself. If you wantto access the GUIDs of extracted attachments, you must use the EloAttachmentGuids property.Note that an internal list of attachment GUIDs is always created since the number of attachments amessage has can vary. How the list is subsequently processed depends on the context this listproperty was configured in. In an External call of type wf, the list remains internal. ELO XC uses it tostart a workflow for each GUID in the list. If it is used in a metadata template, the GUIDs areapplied as field values separated by commas.Publish your changes and start processing. You should now see the following result:70 ELO XCThe new workflow is in the task list:71 ELO XCThe embedded image is still missing. It is definitely an attachment, but it hasn't been processedyet because it is not a file attachment, but an inline attachment. Change the Export action again byenabling the option to include inline attachments.After processing, you will see all parts of the message in the repository:You can also see that the extraction process did not work correctly since the file attachment ismissing:72 ELO XCThis is due to the nature of inline attachments. They are associated with the message body, whichis an intrinsic part of the message. File attachments, on the other hand, are removed from themessage. There are now two workflows for the configured export mode â€“ one for the PDF and onefor the embedded image.Along with EloGuid and EloAttachmentGuids, you can forward the folders of the stored documentsto a workflow with the External call action. The properties used to identify SORDs in the repositoryare:Test this using the last message as an example. You could also vary the example by changing theattachment path and selecting Go to in the task view after filing with the respective workflow andthen checking which folder you are taken to.For the last example, you need a message with two PDF attachments and any other fileattachment. You can also embed an additional image as the fourth attachment and experimentwith different export modes and filters once the example is complete. We recommend that you tryout different parameters in a test environment to help you learn and understand the processingcapabilities of ELO XC.The test message now looks like this:73 ELO</s> 
<s>XCTo extract the PDF attachments, store them, and forward them to a workflow, it is a good idea tofilter by file extensions in the Export action.You can use the Attachment filter list to check the names and accordingly decide whether to includeor exclude the attachments. Regular expressions are used to check the pattern. Change your exportsettings as required. Before you start processing, make sure that the EloAttachmentGuids propertyis set in the External call action. After processing, you should see this result in the repository:74 ELO XCThe two associated workflows also show up in your tasks:However, if you want to store the two attachments that have LDAP-related content, you need tochange the matching pattern in the Export action:75 ELO XCAfter processing, you will find both the PDF and the DOCX file in the repository, and you will noticethat both documents are using the same metadata form. It is configured in the Export action usingthe appropriate parameter for all file attachments (KW_ATTACHMENTS was chosen here):However, it is not always the best approach to assign different file attachments to a singlemetadata form. The PDF could be an invoice, and the DOCX file could be a technical specificationsmanual. The invoice needs to be routed to accounts, and the other file is treated as documentation.These two different purposes are likely to require different metadata forms. You can change theconfiguration in the Export action to ensure that different file extensions are assigned to differentmetadata forms when they are stored:76 ELO XCInformationThe file extension used here is merely the extension of a file name and is intentionally not aregex pattern.77 ELO XCLink message parts In this section, we show you examples of how to link separated message parts in the repositorywhen storing messages with ELO XC. You can then use these scenarios as a basis when you have asimilar scenario in a project.All examples are based on a core feature of ELO XC, which enables you to split e-mails and storetheir attachments separately. You will find this setting in the Export action. Besides the physicalseparation aspect, you also need separate filing paths, which you configure with the Filing pathaction. The configuration of links in the repository is done in the Archive action.Preparations We have used an Outlook connection to a local mailbox for all examples. This is sufficient toillustrate the use cases. The mailbox sends all messages to itself because we do not requiredifferent recipients in the examples:To create the e-mail, we need to prepare two files that we will repeatedly use as attachments:78 ELO XCAn automatically generated instance is used for the basic configuration of ELO XC. The focus is theaction tree for selecting messages as well as the associated subtree that contains the Export and Archive actions:79 ELO XCSet the execution mode of the instance to idle. This means that the instance will only process jobsif started manually. The Simple Archiving acrtion tree is the only active tree in the instance. Itselects all e-mails in the inbox for processing if they have not been archived</s> 
<s>yet:80 ELO XCThe selection criteria do not explicitly include attachments because we are looking for aconfiguration that works for messages with attachments as well as for messages withoutattachments. To ensure that the extracted attachments are also stored separately in the repository,we need to configure a second filing path:81 ELO XCWhile e-mails should be stored in the folder of the mailbox in the mailbox path illustrated, allattachments of this mailbox should be archived in a collection folder.The export action separates the attachments:82 ELO XCTo extract attachments, we could have chosen split or attachmentsonly in addition to splitattachments. In our scenario, we assume that the messages will be stored in their originalstate, since we cannot predict at this point in time in what way we will need them in five, ten, or 20years. This is why the original state takes precedence over forced optimizations of the physicalmemory. However, we still want to store the attachments separately so that we can use them inthe repository.The default metadata template is also useful for attachments. This allows us to see in therepository that a document was originally a attachment, and we can still see the original recipients.Data context is especially important in the long term, when the origin of documents is no longerevident. Therefore, we do not need metadata templates depending on the attachment or additionalfilters for attachments.The Archive action, which stores documents in the repository, is the main action used in theexamples in this section:83 ELO XCThe links to the stored documents are configured using the options highlighted here. We willintroduce these parameters in the following examples. Now you can take another look at yourinstance configuration to check if you have done the right preparation.If all settings are correct, you can process a job in ELO XC. Open the processing statistics:You should see that exactly two items were processed in a mailbox folder. Four itens were archivedâ€“ two e-mails and two attachments. You can check this in the following examples at any time.The e-mail subject in the mailbox has a tag assigned to it:84 ELO XCYou see the configured filing structure in the repository:SORD links SORD links are required to associate documents with each other:You can choose between crossreferenced and permanent. The difference is that permanent linkscannot be removed: crossreferenced is called a mesh link, permanent stands for an inseparable, permanent link. ELO XC selects the technical names from the Indexserver interface.Create a new e-mail with Crossreferenced as the subject and add both attachments:85 ELO XCProcess the Crossreferenced e-mail with ELO XC. You will see the following result in the repository:As expected, three documents were stored and associated with links. To check this, you can displaythe link in the client:86 ELO XCSelect Crossreferenced and open the Link window:87 ELO XCWhen you select one of the entries, you will notice that you can no longer mesh the links. This isbecause of the settings made by ELO XC while the links were being generated. However, you canstill delete the links or convert them into inseparable links.Create</s> 
<s>a new e-mail with the two attachments and call it Permanent link. Next, set the SORD linksin the Archive action to permanent and process the Permanent link e-mail with ELO XC.You will find the stored message parts in the repository, but after opening the links you will see thedifference:These links cannot be deleted and are already permanent mesh links. This means that the Permanent link message parts are irrevocably associated with each other.InformationAssume you have a large repository containing several million documents that is accessedby more than 500 users on a daily basis. It is likely that over the years, the documents willnot remain tied to one location in the repository. In particular, it is probable that extractedattachments will be moved around in the repository. In addition, if filing or folder structuresare reorganized at some point, it is possible that users won't be able to find the attachmentsthat were once separated from the original e-mails. By permanently associating messageparts with each other using SORD links, you no longer need to take steps to relocatemessage parts that can no longer be found. Especially in the case of permanent, inseparablelinks, you can also identify the affiliation of message parts in the long term.Finally, set the SORD links value back to none. Delete all documents stored in this example fromthe repository before continuing with the logical reference example.88 ELO XCReferences by filing path We are going to use the instance configuration that we created in the Preparations section for thisexample. The e-mails will be stored in the repository using the paths configured for this purpose.We will show you how to easily create logical references for stored message parts. First, we createa new path entry for logical references in the Filing path action and configure the Archive action forthe logical references type:We now add a logref type to our filing path. As a result, the Archive action will automatically storeall created logical references in this path. In our example, we assume that the mailbox folders withthe originals in the repository can only be accessed by the respective mailbox owner. However,other users should be able to read the e-mails. To allow this, we create a folder with logicalreferences to the originals in a Shared folder for each mailbox. The Shared folder with read rightsfor all users has already been created in the repository.In the Archive action, we configure the type of references:89 ELO XCThe maindoconly type only creates logical references for the e-mails themselves. The sameapplies for attachmentsonly. With the all type, all message parts are referenced.Modify, validate and publish your configuration as shown here. Then create this e-mail with anattachment:When you start processing, the message parts will be stored as documents and additionalreferences to the documents will be created in the Shared folder:We'll end this simple example with an exercise:Create two new e-mails called Exercise and Exercise with attachments. Modify the configuration sothat you obtain the following result in the repository (example for second e-mail):90 ELO XCYou can still invent your own paths for</s> 
<s>logical references, test them, and create references for justattachments.Before you continue with the next example, delete the paths for logical references from the Filingpath action. Clean up the repository and your mailbox as well.References by metadata field We are going to use the instance configuration that we created in the Preparations section for thisexample. We'll illustrate the process of creating logical references using metadata with animaginary scenario that could actually occur.For this scenario, we are going to create a filing structure for a specific company project. Thecompany builds dams and wind turbines. E-mails are stored separately for each mailbox but theclient wants ELO XC to additionally generate a project association and make the e-mails visibleand/or usable in the project folders. The next section contains some preliminary considerations inthis context.Preliminary considerations We could configure an e-mail filing system that recognizes that an e-mail belongs to a project whileprocessing it. Based on this, we could modify the filing path. However, this means that the originalmessages are not stored in the repository folder of the associated mailbox, but in the project folderin the repository. Of course, there are scenarios where this approach may make sense, especially ifit is a project mailbox that is not associated with a specific project stakeholder.If this association with a specific user exists and the mailbox owner needs to be able to access thee-mails in their own repository folders, we could store the project e-mails twice by configuring theaction tree to create a second after the e-mail is initially stored and then storing it again in the newpath. The company would need to assess whether the project is important enough to justify the91 ELO XCadditional memory this method requires. The use of physical MD5 paths (passive duplicate control)could effectively reduce the amount of physical memory required.However, we are also going to assume that mailbox owners are going to change data after the e-mails and attachments have been stored. If we were to create duplicates, we wouldn't know whichwere the newest changes and how they could be automatically reproduced in the projects.Example: The mailbox owners assigns additional metadata to project e-mail after storage. Thischange is relevant for all project stakeholders. Does the mailbox owner have to assign thismetadata twice? Perhaps this can be justified in exceptions, but if lots of different mailbox ownersdo this for different projects, it is bound to cause organizational problems due to different versionsof duplicates being created.Logical references are a good compromise. Storage of the message parts remains prevalent as itcan be assumed that not all filed messages are relevant to a project. However, if an e-mail isrelevant to a project, it is possible to refer to its attachments in the project folders. As subsequentchanges are only made to the original documents, these are automatically applied to otherversions. Moreover, this also means that the changes don't have to be made twice.Project folder structure Before we configure the logical reference example in ELO XC, we need to create the project folderstructures in the repository:The projects are split</s> 
<s>up into dams and wind turbines. Each project has a project number inbrackets for unique identification (e.g., correspondence, accounts payable, general administration).The project folders also have a more or less standardized child structure:92 ELO XCELO XC does not necessarily require the names of all child folders to be identical. What is importantis the project association, which is assigned with the help of metadata:The project number is added to the folder for project e-mails as the ELOINDEX metadata field. Theletter P stands for project.Create the project child folders and assign each of the E-mails child folders the correct projectnumber in ELOINDEX. The folder structure in the repository should end up like this:93 ELO XCYou only see one open project folder in the figure, but all project folders should contain at least the E-mails child folder with the corresponding ELOINDEX. The documents are stored in the top part(Repository of mailbox owner). We create the logical references in the bottom part (Projectrepository).InformationThe correct SORD is determined using an index search via ELOINDEX. If multiple SORDshave the same value, i.e. the same project number, the SORD is chosen randomly from theset of possible results.Project number There must be a convention for project numbers to allow ELO XC to recognize project e-mails. Inthis example, the project number should be in the e-mail subject. It doesn't matter whether thenumber is shown in brackets at the end of the subject or as a prefix followed by a colon. It couldalso be in the middle of the subjext text.94 ELO XCThe following variations are possible:Progress of dam construction [PNR0119][PNR2025]: Building materials delayedConference [PNR0815] needs to be pushed backThe rule for project numbers is as follows:The project number is always in the e-mail subject.It is enclosed in square brackets, has the prefix PNR for identification, and consists of exactlyfour digits.To identify the project number, therefore, we need to evaluate the subject and find the projectnumber, assuming it exists. This is done with the Match/Replace action, which can parse andtransform strings using regex patterns.However, we face the additional problem that project e-mails use the PNR identifier, while theproject folder structure uses the letter P for the internal identifier in ELOINDEX. This means that notonly do we need to recognize the PNR pattern, but we also need to transform it into the P pattern.We solve the problem by first determining the regex pattern to configure the Match/Replace action.We need to use regex in the ELO XC tools menu:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 95 ELO XCYou can copy the examples above to use in your own exercise. You should also use the Multilineoption. The Singleline option will be sufficient for the e-mail subject later on. You don't have toworry about upper or lowercase.If you enter the pattern .\[PNR(\d{4})\]., the four digits of a project number are bound to the firstmatch group. Enter P$1 as the replace value to generate the required project number format for the96 ELO XCproject folder structure. Click Match to display the match groups. When you click Replace, youshould</s> 
<s>also get the following result:Because the Multiline option was selected, the values were replaced in all input lines. If you canreproduce this result, make a note of the matching pattern and the replace patternÂ in a blank textdocument. We need both patterns later on.Instance configuration We now need to modify the ELO XC configuration so that the item is stored differently depending onwhether a project number is found or not. If a number is not found, the item is stored as normal. Ifa number is found, the item is stored with logical references.First, copy the subtree Subtree Arc and name the copy Subtree Arc Project:97 ELO XCUse the Copy and Paste functions to do this. Use the arrows to adjust the position of the newsubtree.Ensure that the "Checkin" archive action in the Subtree Arc Project subtree creates the logicalreferences:Set all as the SORD reference type. This means that references are created for all message parts.Now you need to set which property value must correspond to the metadata field value so thatwhen it is stored, the logical references are created in the correct location. The e-mail subject isalways PidTagSubject.In this case, it is important that the property source is set to cachedname, since we will not changethe original subject of the message under any circumstances and the converted project number istherefore obtained from the internal copy of the property.In other words, the generated project number of PidTagSubject must match a value in ELOINDEX.Now that we have two subtrees, one with generation of logical references and one without, wehave to make sure that the correct subtree is called. We therefore need to configure a casedistinction before the previous subtree call Call Subtree Arc is executed, so that when a projectnumber is detected, Subtree Arc Project is called instead.In the Simple Archiving active action tree, we now select the ArcPath filing path action:Below this, create the Match/Replace action and give it the name Has Project Number?. Set the startcondition as true:98 ELO XCThe new action appears between ArcPath and Call Subtree Arc:Now create a copy of Call Subtree Arc for the reverse case.MethodSelect the Call Subtree Arc action.Click Copy.Select the ... action.Click Paste.ResultWe now have two identical subtree calls. We rename the action for the case Project number found:In the process, Call Subtree Arc Project must also call the correct subtree for the project repository:99 ELO XCNow that we have arranged the flow of actions logically as required, we need to configure the casedistinction in the Has Project Number? action:100 ELO XCSince we need to convert from PNR to P, the action type must be set to replace. Otherwise, thevalue would only be matched but not replaced. The e-mail subject is the PidTagSubject property. Toensure that the property value generated by the replace action is retained in the copy of theproperty, we need to set cache in the destination field. We configure the matching pattern with thepatterns generated by the regex tool.101 ELO XCExamples Once you have saved, validated, and published the configuration,</s> 
<s>you can generate the firstmessages:We will use a message without a project reference, but with attachments. To test the dynamicrecognition of project numbers functionality, we use two messages with different project numbersaccording to our definition of project numbers, where one message has attachments and the otherdoes not.After processing by ELO XC, you should be able to see this result in the repository:102 ELO XCThe message parts were stored in the usual way. No project and Need assistance both hadattachments, so four attachments were stored.Note the new order of the logical references in the project folder structure:The references were created to match the value in ELOINDEX. You can now use the references viathe context menu in the client:If you want to set the references exclusively for the e-mails or for the attachments, the followingtypes of SORD references are available: maindoconly and attachmentsonly. The principle is thesame. Try some more examples with other e-mails. Vary the project numbers or the number ofattachments.Exercise:103 ELO XCTry to find an alternative minimal configuration of the action trees, because you do not generallyneed the whole copy of the Subtree Arc. You will find the solution at the end of this section.Implicit link There is a predefined field group for extracted attachments in the metadata:The standard e-mail metadata form contains a corresponding metadata field. In ELO XC, the use ofthis default field group in metadata templates must be explicitly configured:104 ELO XCThe default metadata template KWDEFAULTDOCUMENT always uses the ELO reference ELOOUTLREF. The E-mail metadata form and the default metadata template KWDEFAULTDOCUMENT should always be used as an example of e-mail metadata. Even custommetadata forms should contain the field groups of the e-mail metadata form.ELOOUTLREF: The SORD GUID of the original message is always set as the value in the case ofextracted attachments. However, this only works if the message that the attachment wasextracted from was also archived. If the attachmentsonly export type is used, no message/maindocument is archived, meaning thatELOOUTLREF cannot be assigned a value.You should consider carefully whether to use it in your own metadata templates. This also meansthat custom metadata forms used to archive e-mails with extracted attachments should includethis default field group.Example:Extracted attachments were stored without SORD links. At a later point in time, you want to findthe corresponding original message for an attachment. The metadata of the PDF document has anentry for ELOOUTLREF:105 ELO XCYou can use this SORD GUID in the metadata search:Summary â€¢ 106 ELO XCSORD links are useful for associating separated message parts with each other permanently,regardless of where they are stored in the repository.Logical references can be created just by configuring an associated storage path. This simplemethod assumes that the paths for references are known and can be configured directly.With the advanced method for creating logical references, on the other hand, it must bepossible to determine reference paths by comparing a message property to an existingmetadata field value.The use of the reserved field group ELOOUTLREF is intended for matching file attachments totheir original messages. Custom metadata forms should</s> 
<s>use this field group accordingly.Solution to 'Minimal configuration exercise' in the 'References by metadata field'section Since the distinction is made by determining the project number and is only required during thefiling process, only the Archive action is moved to a subtree for the different cases:The Call Checkin subtree action calls Subtree Checkin Project, because the case distinction is onlyneeded for the Archive action.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 107 ELO XCInterval check The Match/Replace action in ELO XC is used to evaluate property values. The action uses regularexpressions, which help to recognize and modify complex string patterns. Checking whether aproperty value is within a specified interval constitutes a special case. Using regex expressions forthis is a complicated method that has its limitations. You therefore have the option to configure matches that allow you to set interval thresholds.Let us assume that you only want an action tree to process messages that are larger than 20 KB or20000 bytes. In a simple use case, you would use the action tree selection restrictions, but in thisexample we will assume that we are not creating any number of action trees and that ELO XCshould perform different cascading size checks. Setting the limit at 20 KB would mean that 100 KB,500 KB, and 1 MB are also included, which would lead to a more complex series of checks. Eachcase distinction would require different follow-up actions.To illustrate the interval check, this example also uses the Move action, which moves thecorresponding messages to the mailbox folders /Inbox/0 KB and /Inbox/20 KB on a case-by-casebasis. The folders should only contain messages that have the required minimum size.The check and the change are clearly illustrated in the action tree.108 ELO XCThe action tree only processes messages that have not been archived. The actions are configureddirectly. The Match/Replace action is required for this example.If you process the two messages with this action tree, the messages will be moved to the correctfolders.In a real-life scenario, you would set up additional cascading size checks in this way:109 ELO XCYou can also use this method to check other properties. The underlying data type is important forthe interval check. You cannot perform an interval check on strings. Only numeric types (integer, long, float, double) and calendar data (DateTime) are suitable for this type of check.Let's assume you need to pre-sort messages according to the time of delivery. ELO XC uses thedelivery time PidTagMessageDeliveryTime (type DateTime) as the default property for determiningthe age of an item.The following examples illustrate how to configure the above check for calendar data. For thecheck by delivery time, the target folders in the mailbox are renamed.110 ELO XCInterval Match and No Interval Match are the target folders. The action tree has the same structurebut has a different name because of the different intended result.The test messages should have completely different delivery times.The positive check should be configured so that the match confirms the interval on June 8, 2022,between 12:30 and 13:30.111 ELO XCBesides entering the correct property name, you must also select the</s> 
<s>upper and lower intervalthresholds according to the date type. This requires the DateTime internal representation type. Thistype always has the ISO date format (14 digits in the order year, month, day, hour, minute,second). There should be no digits missing.In this example, a time between 12:30 and 13:30 is relevant. However, the configuration uses 20220608103000 and 20220608113000 because all properties with timestamps are normalized to UTCtime. Only Outlook performs an automatic localization of the timestamps and changes the viewaccording to the set time zone.Let's assume you now want to check the message age instead of the interval with a fixed time.Static timestamps are not suitable for this. You can configure this by changing the matchingpattern, combining the prefix Age (case-sensitive) with an age specification. An age specificationalways has the format DDHHMMSS with D for the days, H for the hours, M for the minutes, and S forthe seconds.If you want to specify an age between four and five hours, you would use the interval of the Age000050000 and Age000040000 thresholds. The lower threshold should represent the higher age.112 ELO XCIf you want to process the two messages on June 8, 2022 at around 15:00, these two matchingpatterns are sufficient:When determining the message age, i.e. the time difference between an imaginary now and thedelivery time of a message, the time of calculation is especially important, since a message agesfrom the time of its delivery. The reference point for calculating the age is therefore the internaltimestamp, which is always generated at the beginning. Although a job can take longer, theseuncontrollable dynamic factors are eliminated by using the main job timestamp (in EloXcArchivedBase or EloTimeStampJob) to apply a static reference point for age calculation.The interval thresholds with age calculation can be modified even further. Let's assume that onlymessages that are no older than one hour since the job start are relevant. In this case, you wouldset the lower threshold to Age000010000 and the upper one to Age0000000.The age specification 000000000 (nine zeros) tells ELO XC to choose the available extreme values.The upper interval threshold is therefore automatically the job start, since the latencies since the113 ELO XCstart are technically eliminated. The lower threshold is 01.01.1970 00:00:00, a definite date in thepast. Both extreme values are hardwired.The specification of static time limits in ISO format when entering 0000000000 (14 zeros) also usestwo extreme values. If zero is the lower threshold, 01/01/1970 is used internally as with age limits.However, if zero is the upper threshold, it is converted to the timestamp at the time the matchoccurred during processing.There is a third way to perform checks with time intervals. Let's assume that you want to filter onlythose messages whose delivery time is within a specific range of months, days, hours and otherdate parts. For example, you want to process all messages of the first quarter.The pattern has the Map prefix. The entries are case-sensitive. The prefix is followed by ten digitsfor the date, two each for month, day, hour, minute, and second. Years are not allowed in</s> 
<s>thisformat. An X means that a date part of the pattern, such as day or second, is completely discarded,and is instead inherited from the property value. If a date part is represented by digits, these areinherited from the matching pattern. The different date parts in the pattern, except for the year, arecombined with the property value, resulting in the two interval thresholds.The first quarter consists of months 1, 2, and 3. In ISO format, months have two digits, i.e. 01, 02,and 03. Suppose you needed to filter delivery times between 8:00 and 12:00 UTC. The intervalthresholds in this case would be MapXXXX08XXXX and MapXXXX12XXXX.If you want to filter times from the third quarter to the first of the month between 16:00 and 16:10,you need Map07011600XX and Map09011610XX.114 ELO XCUser import Preparations ELO users and their access rights in the repository are central to e-mail storage becausecorrespondence, business or otherwise, should not generally be compromised. It is possible toprepare the repository manually before archiving any e-mails, or it can be done automatically byELO XC. Central to e-mail archiving is the external mailbox owner whose messages are to beprocessed and later made available in the repository. ELO XC groups all external mailbox owners inmailbox catalogs, which are created when external directories are queried.Automatic import of user accounts from the catalog is not a default setting in ELO XC, because itcan lead to conflicts with the LDAP import function in the ELO Administration Console or existinglegacy data. However, if you have already used the ELO Indexserver LDAP connection, there isnothing to prevent you from allowing ELO XC to import users, but you should consider whether thisis actually necessary or whether the LDAP connection is not the better function. ELO XC is limited tomailbox properties. Nevertheless, both import methods are compatible as they both identify theexternal users based on the GUID in the directories. This allows ELO XC to import user data beforethe ELO Indexserver LDAP connection is used without preventing it being used later on.With local directories, the integrated ELO XC mode is generally used for the LDAP connection, whichdelegates the import to the Indexserver and guarantees uniform data transfer.The automatic import of user accounts therefore requires careful planning, which should essentiallybe based on which interfaces are available, at what time user access is to be expected, and towhat extent the local administration can independently transfer user data into ELO.In addition, the different mailbox types processed by ELO XC as well as the filing path influence theresulting permission settings after an e-mail has been stored. Therefore, this usage exampleconsists of several parts, which build on one another and also illustrate central control mechanismsof ELO access permissions.We recommend that you test the configuration examples and verify the usage example with yourown tests depending on your individual level of experience.You need:ELO 21ELO Administration ConsoleELO clientMicrosoft Outlook3x user mailboxes â€“ 1x sender, 2x recipients1x shared mailbox (with these user mailboxes as delegates)ELO XCMicrosoft Active DirectoryMicrosoft 365Remote PowerShell (PowerShell with EXO module 2.0.4 or higher)â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</s> 
<s>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 115 ELO XCApp registration with certificate authorization in Microsoft 365 tenant and app permissions fordelegation via EWS and Exchange management in the role of Exchange administratorStandard method The standard method in ELO XC is based on the assumption that the user structure has beenconfigured in the repository before the first mailboxes are archived. Mailboxes are only associatedwith ELO data via the filing path using the automated functions of form permissions, which alsoplay an essential role in the following examples with automatic user import. The standard methodis used specifically if you want to separate external users and ELO users. However, it must be usedif a static mailbox catalog has been configured.In this example, a user gets a separate folder in the main folder E-mails (prepared), in whichmessages will be stored according to the folder structure in Outlook. This folder should be namedafter its SMTP address:Both folders are created using the default folder form so that all users have access to them.However, since we want to configure a user-specific e-mail repository, the stored e-mails must beprotected against unauthorized access by other users using appropriate permission settings.The first step is to create the user. This is done in the ELO Administration Console:After you save the new user, it shows up in the list:116 ELO XCIn the client, you now set the permissions for both folders. Navigate to the main folder E-mails(prepared).All users have read access to the main folder:The user folder that will contain the stored mailbox is assigned permission settings that grant xc191 the rights to read the e-mails, move them, and change their metadata as needed:117 ELO XCOnce the folders have been configured accordingly, messages for xc191 can be stored. Theexpected Outlook folder structure is automatically secured based on the permission settings of themetadata forms used. The default Folder and E-mail forms already have the required Parent rightspermissions settings, which ensures that permissions for the transferred mailbox folders andmessages are passed on correctly during processing.We will now use ELO XC to configure simple e-mail storage. The action is based on the metadatatemplates KWDEFAULTDOCUMENT and KWDEFAULTFOLDER. KWDEFAULTDOCUMENT is assigned tothe stored documents or messages and KWDEFAULTFOLDER is assigned to the created folders:Both metadata templates are part of the default settings of ELO XC, which is why they are verifiedevery time ELO XC is started. If they are missing, ELO XC automatically creates them. In addition,they already contain the default mappings of message properties to metadata fields, which is whythey shouldn't be changed. If other templates are required, you can create customized copies ofthe two standard templates.This simple storage process uses an active Archive Simple action tree.118 ELO XCThe active action tree calls a subtree (or template tree) in which Export, Archiving, Tag, and Saveare configured.To ensure that the correct filing target is used in the repository, the Filing path action must beconfigured in advance.119 ELO XCDuring filing, the path is created by using existing path items and creating missing ones. Thisensures that the settings</s> 
<s>of the folders E-mails (prepared) and xc191@xc.local remain unchanged.This also means that the path segments in the repository are not changed by ELO XC once theyhave been created because the only identifier used is the folder name.The segment for the main folder is configured as follows:120 ELO XCSince the name E-mails (prepared) is assigned by default and cannot be changed, the segmenttype must be set to constant. The metadata template of this path segment remains empty becausethe KWDEFAULTFOLDER template is already set at the top level of the entire action. If you want touse different templates for individual segments of the filing path, using different metadata forms,for example, you can configure this in this field of the segment. However, the segments are notlinked to the metadata in this example.The automatically generated name of the next segment in this example is the mailbox SMTPaddress. The variable BoxAddr is responsible in this case.The third path segment uses the BoxPath variable, which is used to transfer the structure fromOutlook during filing. Now, when messages are processed, you can see in the repository that thedesired permission settings are automatically applied correctly:Automatic import of user accounts This example with automatic user import for e-mail storage also assumes that there is a mainfolder, which will now be called E-mails (unprepared). This is where the mailbox folders withOutlook structures will be stored after filing. This does not require any preparations in therepository. Also, no ELO users are created. If you only want to test the configuration, the createdELO users have to be deleted again before each test.121 ELO XCTo do this, you need to enable to the automatic import option under ELO settings in the instanceconfiguration.Description of several parameters:Assume ownership: Enabling the Assume ownership option means that the userautomatically created in the repository is also entered as the owner of the newly createddocuments.Identity format: This selection field determines which catalog property to use as the ELO username. The possible properties are UserPrincipalName, sAMAccountName, CN, and IxLdap.Default ACL: This where you specify the ACL for the user folder. This permission setting isapplied to all transferred items based on the inheritance mechanisms of the metadata form. RW was selected here to distinguish it from RWDELP.InformationIdentity formats: When using IxLdap, you must have configured and enabled the IndexserverLDAP connection. In this case, ELO XC does not perform import the users itself, but insteadregisters the user in the background during processing, which causes the LDAP connection toimport the data. When using the other identity formats, ELO XC maps the external user dataitself. In this case, the passwords of newly created users are automatically generated andsent to the mailbox owners. This requires a valid SMTP address of the service account usedto send the service messages.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 122 ELO XCIf you store an e-mail with these settings, you will get the following result:The message Automatically without taking ownership is archived and is assigned the configuredpermissions settings RW. In addition, the user xc191 is notified that the ELO user account wascreated:The user is</s> 
<s>now able to to log on to the repository where they will be prompted to set their ownpassword:If you enable the Assume ownership option in the instance configuration, each stored e-mail andeach filing path folder created in this way will be assigned to the mailbox owner as if they hadstored it manually:123 ELO XCIf you do not enable this option, the stored message will be automatically assigned to the serviceaccount.The assignment of rights in automatic user import only works properly if the filing path uses avariable that is associated with the mailbox owner:The variables are assigned as follows:Variable LDAP user propertyBoxAccount sAMAccountNameBoxAddr mailBoxName displayNameBoxUPN UserPrincipalNamePlease noteIf one of these variables is detected in the filing path and assigned a corresponding value,ELO XC simultaneously sets the configured ACL for the path segment. It therefore makessense to use only one variable that is associated with a mailbox for each filing path. At thesame time, one of these variables must always be configured for successful and securemailbox emulation. If this is not the case, data could be compromised. You must configureELO XC so that it is not possible to create overlapping paths for different mailboxes.For example, if an alphabetical folder structure is required for filing e-mails from differentmailboxes, you should create it in advance. If ELO XC creates the folder structure when124 ELO XCstoring e-mails with user import, the access permissions are set according to what was filedfirst.When you check whether the users have been imported in the ELO Administration Console, you willfind both the user xc191 and the user group ELOxc_USERS:The user name xc191@xc.local is taken from the directory propertyUserPrincipalName. If thisidentity is selected, the Windows user is automatically set in the format <domain>\<account>.The SMTP address is applied as the e-mail address and the newly created user is automaticallyassigned to the ELOxc_USERS group stored in the configuration with the group prefix and groupmembership parameters:InformationThe user ID cannot be changed because it is determined automatically by the ELO AccessManager. It is an internal identifier and plays an important role in user import by integrating125 ELO XCuser data sets and permissions settings. It is the main reason why users previouslyimported from an external directory have to be identified in ELO. If this is not the case,permissions settings will be lost, orphaned, or incorrectly assigned. If users are importedwith the ELO Indexserver LDAP connection or imported by ELO XC, the directory property objectGUID identifies the users. When importing users with LDAP in the ELO AdministrationConsole, you need to make an alteration if you want to use the objectGUID.When using LDAP mailbox catalogs, supervisors defined in ELO are automatically assigned to ELOusers. This requires the LDAP property manager.The user xc192 is assigned xc191 as supervisor in the local directory:If user import is enabled, the ELO user xc191 is automatically entered as the supervisor of ELO userxc192 when this user is created:If the manager property is not set, the ELO Administrator is entered as the supervisor. Duringsubsequent processing, if the property is available or has changed, the</s> 
<s>setting will be applied.ELO user entries with automatic import In order to apply the automatic user import settings to the user entries and to store e-mails inthese structures, you need to modify the configuration of the filing path. In this case, you need toset user instead of the default value archive.126 ELO XCELO user entries are part of the default configuration of a repository and are shared with all ELOusers. Each user has a personal area in the repository, which cannot be accessed by other users. Ifyou set the root of the filing path to user, the e-mails will be stored in this area. This eliminates theneed to create a folder that is associated with a mailbox, which is why the filing path is easier toconfigure:If you now store a message, you can see that the permissions settings of the user's personal areaare automatically applied:Shared mailboxes with automatic import If you want to store messages from a shared mailbox, two different mailbox types are available â€“ shared and user:127 ELO XCA shared mailbox shared19 with configured delegates xc191 and xc192 is processed with thesetting shared. This triggers mailbox emulation, which processes shared19 as the mailboxes xc191and xc192. For this to work, the filing path must use a variable that is associated with the mailbox,indirectly associating the delegate as its owner. The path configuration could look like this:If the e-mail is stored using the mailbox type shared, the result in the repository looks like this:Each delegate receives a copy of the processed message. The permissions correspond to theconfiguration of the instance configuration. However, if the e-mail is stored with the mailbox type="user" in native mode, ELO XC uses this filing structure:128 ELO XCOnly one message copy is stored for the shared and in this case not emulated, i.e. resolvedmailbox shared19@xc.local.In terms of the permission settings when processing a shared mailbox, regardless of whether youselect the type user or shared, an ELO user group is always created whose members are thedelegates of shared19@xc.local. The difference is that type="shared" assigns individual accessrights and type="user" assigns group rights.In the ELO user manager, you can see that a user group called shared19@xc.local was created for shared19@xc.local. This user group is a member of the general group ELOxc_USERS. This occursindependently of type="shared" and type="user", reflecting the mailbox configuration andprobably the mailbox usage.The mailbox delegates are assigned to the user group shared19@xc.local:129 ELO XCIf you use mailbox emulation in native mode, the result for the path root user is congruent to theresult for the path root archive.This is what the result with mailbox emulation looks like:130 ELO XCThis is the result with native mode, i.e. without mailbox emulation:Journal recipients with automatic import User accounts are also automatically transferred when processing journal recipients. However, ajournal is not used in the same sense as shared mailboxes. A journal recipient is a user mailboxand is therefore treated by ELO as a user.As long as a journal is configured as the mailbox type journal in ELO XC, mailbox emulation withautomatic creation</s> 
<s>of all users whose mailboxes are on the same Exchange server mailboxdatabase will occur as expected. However, if the journal is processed in native mode, useraccounts are created in ELO for all journal mailbox owners as well as the user account of thejournal recipient.E-mail storage with mailbox emulation (type="journal") of the journal recipient journal19@xc.local:E-mail storage with type="user" in native mode produces this result:131 ELO XCDue to native mailbox processing, the journal recipient and the journal mailbox owners appear inthe user manager:If an e-mail is stored in the ELO repository using mailbox emulation and the path root user, it isstored in the user's personal area:With native processing (type="user") of the journal recipient in ELO, only one message copy isstored in the repository for journal19@xc.local.132 ELO XCE-mail storage of journal recipients in native mode differs from native mode with shared mailboxesnot only because the user journal19 is also transferred. In this case, other messages are stored aswell:The original message is stored in the journal recipient's mailbox as an attachment to an envelope.The envelope contains the recipients of the message. E-mail storage of journal recipients in nativemode is therefore more suited for meeting requirements for documentation of e-mailcorrespondence than is user-based e-mail storage. If you still want ELO users to be able to accessthese messages at a later date, it is possible to extract the original message using downstreamprocesses and make them available to automatically imported ELO users with appropriatepermissions settings.Mailbox catalogs with automatic import The different catalog types in ELO XC all retrieve the main user properties Name, Windows user,and E-mail. ELO XC also applies the GUID (objectGUID property) of the external mailbox owner asthe ELO user GUID. If users are created manually, there is no external GUID so you need toconfigure the LDAP import function in the ELO Administration Console to use this GUID. Theexternal GUID is essential for data transfer later on, which is why it is also specified as the defaultsetting for the ELO Indexserver LDAP connection.133 ELO XCIn addition to the main user properties, ELO XC stores additional catalog data in the ldapuserpropstable of the ELO Access Manager, which can be retrieved via the Indexserver API.The table below illustrates how properties are mapped according to the access constants in theIndexserver API:InformationIn the ps column, the external names correspond to PowerShell naming conventions.External name ldap m365 UserInfoCdisplayName X X LDAPKEYDISPLAY_NAMEdistinguishedName X X LDAPKEYDISTINGUISHED_NAMElegacyExchangeDN X X LDAPKEYLEGACYEXCHANGEDNMail X LDAPKEYMAILPrimarySmtpAddress X LDAPKEYMAILManager X LDAPKEYMANAGERmsExchRecipientTypeDetails X LDAPKEYEXCHRECIPIENTTYPE_DETAILSRecipientTypeDetails X LDAPKEYEXCHRECIPIENTTYPE_DETAILSperson person LDAPKEYOBJECT_CLASSobjectGUID X LDAPKEYOBJECT_GUIDGuid X LDAPKEYOBJECT_GUIDfalse LDAPKEYONLINEtrue LDAPKEYONLINEsAMAccountName X LDAPKEYSAMACCOUNTNAMEsamAccountName X LDAPKEYSAMACCOUNTNAMEuserPrincipalName X X LDAPKEYUSERPRINCIPALNAMEIt is possible to configure external properties as main user properties (Name, Windows user and E-mail using the Identity format parameter, although Name=UserPrincipalName, Windowsuser=domain\account, and E-mail=SMTP address should remain the preferred default.Name=account and Windows user=UserPrincipalName can be useful if you have older repositories.User data is only created if it is missing and is not updated after that, so you must carefullyconsider whether ELO Access Manager databases should do without the preferred default settings.ELO Indexserver LDAP connection With the default</s>

Nevertheless, it makes sense for the LDAP connection and the userimport from ELO XC to generate the same result for the main ELO user properties Name, Windows user, and E-mail.Summary ELO XC can only set the permissions of newly created items in the repository. Once data isarchived, the settings in the repository cannot be changed. Access permissions to items in therepository must always be set with the client. Automatically transferred users are retained even ifthey are subsequently deleted in the directory. This also applies for the LDAP property manager.With the default configuration, it is necessary to define the settings, including the permissionsettings, for storing e-mails in the repository. The default metadata forms Folder and E-mail areuseful configuration tools and are available as standard metadata templates of ELO XC.Automatic import of user accounts is an option that allows you to avoid manual configuration offiling structures. The mailbox owners are imported as ELO users and assigned access rights thatcorrespond to the mailbox type depending on the configured processing type. The main userproperties GUID, Name, SMTP address and Account or UserPrincipalName can be applied for allcatalog groups. Furthermore, additional directory data is stored in ELO Access Manager.135 ELO XCWhen mapping external data to user properties in ELO, however, make sure that you avoid conflictssince, for example, manual creation of users with simultaneous transfer by ELO XC can causeambiguities that you may not notice until later on and are difficult to correct.It is therefore important that you answer the following questions when creating or rebuilding arepository:How will users be managed in the long term? Where will they be managed?Will there only be ELO users, or will all user data be imported from an external source?Have you made sure that ELO Administrator and ELO Service (and other service accounts, ifapplicable) are not generated from external sources? If the main user accounts are to bemanaged externally, have you made sure thatÂ their passwords remain changed so as not todisable active ELO components?Which component meets the administrative requirements for automatic user transfer: LDAPconnection, LDAP import, or ELO XC?The key aspects of permissions configuration for e-mail storage as illustrated in this example are:ELO Administration Console: Creation and validation of users and groupsLDAP connection: Import of user accounts (general and at granular level)Metadata forms and fields: Default metadata forms Folder and E-mailMetadata templates: KWDEFAULTFOLDER and KWDEFAULTDOCUMENTMailbox types: user, shared, journalImport of user accounts: Activation, identity format, assume ownershipFiling paths: Path root archive or user, variables associated with a mailboxThe mailbox type user is always associated with native processing.

They will replace the standardmetadata forms in ELO in the long term. Aspects were introduced as an advanced way to classifydata by group name. Aspects are field groups and the associated aggregates, whereas the indexgroups associated with standard metadata forms only permit assignment of single values. Thisexample contains instructions on how to configure an aspect form for ELO XC as an alternative tothe standard E-mail metadata form.Aspect In ELO, an aspect can be interpreted as a user data aspect (i.e. documents and folders). Forexample, invoices could be defined by an address aspect, but also by an an e-mail aspect (if theinvoice was received by e-mail). The address is likely to contain a first name, last name, streetaddress, postal code, and town, while an e-mail contains the names and SMTP addresses of therecipients. User data can therefore be interpreted and evaluated according to different criteria,which can be organized and implemented using aspects. Technically speaking, an aspect is anamed field set.Aspect field An aspect can contain multiple fields of a type. For an address, the street or house number wouldbe single aspect fields. An aspect contains at least one field. The available field set is determinedby all defined aspect fields.Aspect mappings An aspect mapping establishes a link between a form and aspects and determines their cardinality,i.e. whether these aspects are used individually or as a list.Example: The e-mail address is an independent aspect determined by the Display name and SMTPaddress field set. This aspect can be used for the sender and the three possible recipient lists To, Cc, and Bcc.From Max max@dot.comHugo hugo@gmail.comCc John j.smith@outlook.astroGroup Central gc.group@domain.deIf you want to evaluate an e-mail based on the recipient aspect, it is sufficient to organize the dataaccording to the associated aspect. You would store each recipient irrespective of their role, sincean e-mail address is always an e-mail address, whether it is used to send or receive e-mails.137 ELO XCThe role needs to be configured as an aspect mapping in the form. The From mapping would usethe aspect individually, and the To, Cc, and Bcc mappings would use the aspect in a list as anaggregate.The following configuration steps show how to build a corresponding aspect form according to thestructure of the standard e-mail metadata form.Source: 'E-mail' metadata form 138 ELO XCTarget: 'E-mail demo' aspect form Create aspect form Support for aspect forms Aspect forms are part of packages and are managed with the ELO Administration Console.You can create a new package in the Package administration menu.139 ELO XC140 ELO XC140] ELO XCPackage= XC_PACKfp Delete packageNamespace *DEMOName</s>

You cannow configure it.You need to configure aspect forms under the Metadata forms and Aspects entries:141 ELO XCAspects First, you need to configure the aspects. This involves defining aspects and the associated fields,which can then be assigned to forms.Under Aspects, you can add new aspects.142 ELO XCExample using an e-mail ID:The aspect is assigned an identifier, a text association for localization purposes, and a data field.Configure the data field as follows:143 ELO XCThis example only uses text fields. Aspects are identified by the prefix ASP and the runtimelocalization is identified by the prefix LBL. It is possible to use an own name.Finally, you need to save the settings of the new aspect. Afterwards, the aspect appears in the list.The central aspect for e-mails is required for recipients, which can behave differently. A recipientcan have a name as well as the SMTP address, and the recipients can assume different recipientroles in a single e-mail.144 ELO XCTo configure the standard e-mail metadata form for use with aspects, we also need aspects for thereference GUID, the mailbox path, and the correspondence. These aspects must be availablebefore we create the form with the required mappings.145 ELO XCMetadata form Now you can create the form with the required aspect mappings. First, create the form:Afterwards, you need to assign the aspects to the form and specify the view type. Whereas allaspects are used individually in an e-mail, it is necessary to distinguish between an individualsender and the various recipient lists. This requires four mappings.146 ELO XCSender:Recipient list:147 ELO XCOnce you have created the appropriate mappings for the other recipients and all other aspects, theform configuration should end up looking like this:148 ELO XCThe view types of the mappings were selected so that the form can also be used if individual fieldvalues are not available (optional). The aspects (data structures) and the form mappings (usagetype of data structures) are now configured. Before the form can be used, you have to create atleast one view.The form should be used as the default:149 ELO XCAfterwards, the view appears in the list of metadata form properties where it can be edited:First, you need to add the SORD fields:150 ELO XCAfterwards, you can add the relevant mappings for e-mails one by one.You can specify the view type while creating the fields.151 ELO XCExample:In the case of e-mails, you should select the type Normal for all mappings except To, Cc, and Bcc.These should be assigned the List type. Since From with the Normal type and To, Cc or Bcc use thesame aspect, two different views are needed, which should be displayed automatically dependingon the mapping. The views can be created in direct relation to the aspect so that they are availablefor the mapping. The views for the ASPADDR aspect look like this:It makes sense to consider whether you want to use the display texts of the fields or the</s> 
<s>mapping.In the case of some fields, a custom view is the suitable option. The ASPADDR aspect is a pair offields that is displayed separately and in lists, so it makes more sense to display the names of themapping in addition to the field names.Once you have completed the configuration, the new form should look like this:152 ELO XC153 ELO XCfa nox> SORD_FIELDS (Aspect mapping)LBL_ASPIDEDLBL_ASPREFEDLBL_ASPCONVEDLBL_ASPPATHEDLBL_ASSOCADDR_FROM (Aspect mapping)> LBL_ASSOCADDR_TO (Aspect mapping)> LBL_ASSOCADDR_CC (Aspect mapping)> LBL_ASSOCADDR_BCC (Aspect mapping)Display After saving the form, you can test the result in the ELO client. You can see that the display textsare not configured yet and that the technical name is still being used.The localized display texts are stored as name-value pairs in a properties file in the /Administration/Localization/custom folder. You can use these to configure the display texts of theforms.154 ELO XCELO XC configuration A new metadata template for the new form needs to be created in ELO XC.155 ELO XCDue to the complexity of aspect forms, you need to proceed carefully here since the differentlevels of template configuration mean that there are more mutual dependencies than with thestandard metadata forms. First, select the form and save the fragment. Next, set the metadatafields according to the aspect mappings and save the fragment again. Configure the aspect fieldsas metadata identifiers.156 ELO XCThe metadata name is the aspect mapping.The mapping ID contains the field name defined in the underlying aspect.157 ELO XCThe property name is the Exchange field or ELO field that you want to transfer to the aspect field.If you assign this metadata template to an export, the aspect form is used for processed e-mails.The metadata template will look like this in the client:158 ELO XCProcessing online archives In the Exchange admin center (EAC), you can enable online archives in Exchange mailboxes.Technically, these are secondary mailboxes that are automatically available after successfulmailbox authentication. Access to the contents of these mailboxes is provided based on the knownfolders managed by Exchange. This best practice example shows you how to configure ELO XC toprocess these online archives.Not every mailbox has a secondary mailbox. To allow ELO XC to resolve and search the secondarymailbox folders for content, you need to configure the instance accordingly:Selecting the Archive mailbox folder group causes ELO XC to query Exchange for folders in thesecondary mailbox. The value of Archive mailbox root determines the display name used for theroot of the determined folder structure. If the mailbox path is used to create the repository filingpath, this display name is always part of all filing paths of secondary mailbox items that areprocessed. For example, if message A is in the inbox of the primary mailbox, and message B is inthe inbox of the secondary mailbox, the mailbox paths used to store the messages will bedifferent. A is stored in the \Inbox path and B is stored in \Archive\Inbox. If you want the same pathsto be used, you can also configure ** for the root of the archive mailbox. Keep in mind thatsecondary mailboxes are managed by Exchange and</s> 
<s>not all known folders are automaticallyalways available. For example, when a secondary mailbox is created with Exchange 2019, theInbox folder is not available.159 ELO XCWhen you have finished scaling the instances, you can customize the action tree that will processarchive mailboxes:When ELO XC starts processing a mailbox, all available and configured folders are determined andan internal folder cache is built. This takes time and can be avoided by only including action treesfor the folder groups that actually need them. At the same time, this means that you need toenable an action tree with the Archive mailboxes option in order to include the Archive mailboxfolder group. Afterwards, the corresponding folder variables are available and are automaticallysuggested when configuring the entry points. In this example, select {%ARCMSGROOT}.Once you have configured the filing path to use EloBoxPath, you can test the configuration with twotest messages to the same recipient:160 ELO XCMove one of the messages to the online archive:Start the instance. After the job is finished, you can find the stored messages in the repository indifferent paths:161 ELO XCOptimizing journaling performance ELO XC processes user mailboxes and journaling mailboxes differently. Whereas processing of usermailboxes can be extremely varied and the processing states are evident in user mailboxes, themain purpose of journaling is to process as many messages as possible in as short a time aspossible. This best practice tip explains journaling, shows some examples of runtime tests todetermine a suitable base configuration, and explains some more advanced configuration optionsfor environment scaling.Journals Journals are envelopes that contain original messages. Journal recipients are either configuredlocally for a mailbox store, or they are forwarded using transport rules in Microsoft 365. Technically,journal recipients are native user mailboxes. Journaling is generally used when a complete recordof messages needs to be maintained. With the tests presented here, latencies could become asecond underlying motivation for using journals.Messages are forwarded to a journal at the transport level. When transporting a message, if asender and/or recipient is found to which the journal rule applies (that is, the same mailbox store ora mention in the transport rule), Exchange puts the original message in an envelope, writes the listof all recipients on the envelope, and sends it to the journal recipient. The journal recipient gets themessages in this format:162 ELO XCReading out journal envelopes When processing journals, ELO XC examines each envelope to determine the relevant recipients.This occurs in two steps. First, it extracts SMTP addresses with regex:The catalog data is subsequently used to check which recipients can be used for mailboxemulation. If a mailbox catalog only contains the mailbox xc162 as in the example above, theemulation would only occur for this mailbox. However, if the catalog contains all recipients, onlythe mailboxes of those mailbox stores configured for the currently processed journal recipient willbe emulated. Microsoft 365 does not have this filter because it does not include mailbox stores.Mailbox emulation Mailbox emulation stores the original messages for each relevant recipient as if they were beingprocessed in the associated user mailbox. It is used for</s> 
<s>journal messages and shared mailboxes.Unlike processing mailboxes directly, emulation has the advantage that the original messages donot have to be uploaded to the ELO Indexserver multiple times. Instead, an internal copy is createdvia IX-API. This reduces the volume of data that has to be transmitted.Comparison of journals and user mailboxes The number of messages in journals is likely to be significantly higher than in user mailboxes. Atthe same time, journal mailboxes are not accessed because there is no mailbox owner workingproductively with the mailbox. Therefore, to process journal recipients, EO XC needs be able toquickly reduce large amounts of data.While usability often plays an important role in processing user mailboxes, the main goal in journalmailboxes is to make the most of the performance limits of the environment. In this context,usability is generally hard to reconcile with performance.Processing time The following tests compare the performance of direct mailbox processing and journal processing.They illustrate the basic options available in the ELO XC configuration for improving performance.Test environment The ELO system is a ten-year-old Windows 2012 R2 with an older MSSQL and various Tomcats (ELOservers 12, 20, and 21 with ELO Administration Console, ELO Indexserver, ELO Web Forms Services,and ELO Web Client). The ELO 21 server also contains ELO Flows. To make it easier to comparedata, the full text function and event-controlled scripts are disabled.163 ELO XChttps://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-XJRNL/%5BMS-XJRNL%5D.pdfhttps://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-XJRNL/%5BMS-XJRNL%5D.pdfThe Microsoft Exchange environment includes a standalone test domain and two MicrosoftExchange servers (2016, 2019) with the mailboxes xc161, xc162, xc191, and xc192. The journal ison Microsoft Exchange 2016. Exchange runs with the default throttling settings. To speed up thegeneration of test data, the Exchange transport services were slightly adjusted.Based on previous tests, only three workers are used here, as otherwise there is a risk ofprocessing errors due to Exchange being overloaded (server busy or internal errors) with severalthousand items towards the end of the jobs.These default scaling values were used:Tests The test series evaluates the optimization steps in processing user mailboxes and journals startingfrom the default configuration to the maximum optimized configuration. Standard archivingassumes that messages are archived and tagged so that they are kept in the mailbox for a whileafterwards. Only a second action tree deletes archived messages with a delay.The first optimization step assumes that messages can be deleted immediately after archiving,which is a problematic assumption in user mailboxes, but not in journals. Therefore, archiving anddeletion are executed directly one after the other in this optimization step. Archiving sets the164 ELO XCidentifier (guid) and deletion evaluates it (search for guid in the repository). Both are part of the secure deletion standard method. In the second step, it is assumed that after successful archiving,messages may be deleted unchecked, i.e. without secure deletion.In terms of optimizing journals, these fundamental questions are important:Why does a message have to be stored in Exchange if no one sees it and it is going to bedeleted afterwards anyway?Why would anyone need to search the repository for a message that has just been stored?This leads to three different configuration in this</s> 
<s>series of tests.A estimation of the costs for a whole export in user mailboxes:Two action trees (double selection): EX-Bind, IX-Path, IX-DocBegin, IX-Upload, IX-DocEnd, EX-Save, EX-Bind, IX-Search, EX-DeleteOne action tree (simple selection): EX-Bind, IX-Path, IX-DocBegin, IX-Upload, IX-DocEnd, IX-Search, EX-DeleteOne action tree (simple selection): EX-Bind, IX-Path, IX-DocBegin, IX-Upload, IX-DocEnd, EX-DeleteThere is also the distinction between exporting messages as a whole or if the attachments areextracted and filed separately. With the export type splitattachments, the cost of storage throughthe Indexserver multiplies with the number of message parts, and the cost for the filing pathdoubles (once for the message and once for the file attachments). With emulation, the costassociated with storage through the Indexserver is drastically reduced from the second addresseeonwards, because after filing the first message copy, all other copies are created by copying.Please noteThe IX-Path cost item can have a significant far-reaching effects. For example, user pathswith an underlying seconds path, where all parts of a date (year, month, day, hour, minute,seconds) are used to create the path. Statistically speaking, almost every message wouldtherefore have a unique filing path that has to be generated via IX-API. In this series of tests,paths are used that make a maximum distinction between user and message part (messageor file attachment).The tests use these combinations in the configuration settings:â€¢ â€¢ 165 ELO XCConfiguration 1: Line 15 - 20Configuration 2: Line 21 - 24Configuration 3: Line 25 - 28Points of measurement and potential impairments The test duration is always the difference between job end and job start. The costs associated withsetting up ELO XC (e.g. Autodiscover, authentication, cache updates, determination of defaultfolders) are included in the measurement as an unspecific constant.The respective current size in the ELO database can vary depending on the test. A size below therange of one million SORDs is considered negligible.Storage-only operations in ELO XC (specifically extraction of attachments) or more complex actionssuch as Match/Replace and internal evaluations of the filing path cache are considered marginaland are not taken into account.Creation of the test data and test runs took place over several days, during which the basicperformance of the entire infrastructure, particularly network load, varied. These potentialimpairments are also considered negligible.Since mailbox emulation is optimized for storage of multiple documents, the correspondingvolumes are not actually considered as transferred from ELO XC to the ELO Indexserver. Instead,the volumes correspond to the user data effectively generated in the physical filing paths.Test data For each test, 1,000 programmatically generated identical messages with attachments were sentto the four user mailboxes (body size three KB and six attachments totaling 267 KB). The journalmessages are automatically generated in the Exchange environment. The overall sizes showâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 166 ELO XCdifferences that can be attributed to differences in the internal structure of the MIME data (e.g.,routes, headers, times, MIME part IDs). In contrast, the e-mail payload data stays the same.Results for configuration 1 Results for configuration 2 Results for configuration 3 167 ELO XCCumulative comparison If all results according to the basic configurations are combined to show values for the use</s> 
<s>ofmailboxes with specific actions in practice (combination of user mailboxes and journals), thefollowing comparison data emerges:Overall result The more the configurations are optimized, the higher the performance. The dramatic performanceincrease in configuration 2 compared to configuration 1 indicates that storage in Exchange is veryexpensive. In contrast, the small increase in configuration 3 compared to configuration 2 indicatesthat there is little difference between secure and insecure deletion, meaning that the Indexservercosts are low at this point.The comparison between A and B also shows that there is no linear relationship between wholeexport and the splitattachments export type. If you were archiving seven times the number ofitems and the data volume doubled, the data flow would not be reduced sevenfold, but would bethree times higher. This confirms the assumption that Exchange costs are significantly higher thanthose of the Indexserver, especially since additional Indexserver-side optimizations can be used formultiple filing sequences.The highest performance measurements for A and B were obtained in tests 26 and 28 for journalemulation with immediate deletion. The comparison between test 26 with 22 and test 28 with 24clearly shows that insecure deletion is not relevant. However, it must be taken into account thatonly ELO XC generated load on the ELO server.Irrespective of these results, simple archiving of a single mailbox, with no extraction, noemulation, and regardless of whether it was a user mailbox or a journal, has the lowest processingtime (25 percent of the costs of test 25). For qualitative testing, this optimized processing variantmust be discounted because it also produces the least benefit and is trivial.An Indexserver with few running services offers significantly higher performance than an Exchangeserver under the same conditions. Conversely, this means that improving the performance of theExchange environment (e.g. transport, throttling, hardware) is preferable to optimizing the ELOserver. Nevertheless, it is advisable to optimize performance of both environments and avoidsuboptimal use of the ELO server resources.168 ELO XCOptimizing journal archiving The ideal configuration for processing journal mailboxes is one that natively processes journalrecipients as if they were a user mailbox, in other words, without emulating addressee mailboxesor extracting attachments.The highest performance when processing journal mailboxes is achieved while maximizing thebenefits.In any case, you should avoid unnecessary write operations in Exchange. When processing journals,there is also no need to change messages and save these changes. Specific project requirementsthat call for greater usability may require a compromise or environment scaling.It is much less expensive to use journaling to store messages by user in the repository than tonatively process the associated user mailboxes.Consequences Two different use cases arise as a consequence of journal archiving:If journaling is used to meet compliance requirements, native processing of journalmailboxes is ideal and the resulting advantages are limited to the compliance aspect.Usability is irrelevant in this case.If journaling is needed to store messages by user in the repository, standard journaling withmailbox emulation is preferable to processing user mailboxes and has the highestperformance in terms of compliance and user support.Journals and 'Microsoft 365' (premium journaling) Journal recipients for Microsoft 365 are known as premium</s> 
<s>journaling. Their recipients cannot beconfigured through mailbox stores, but must be set up as transport rules to mailboxes outside of Microsoft 365. The following test results compare the method of processing user mailboxes in Microsoft 365 with ELO XC and natively processing an on-premises Exchange user mailbox aspremium journaling.Configurations used:Standard archiving and save (action tree 1); secure deletion (action tree 2)Standard archiving and immediate secure deletion (single action tree)Standard archiving and immediate insecure deletion (single action tree)The test data was generated programmatically and in the same way as in the previous tests.â€¢ â€¢ 169 ELO XCResults for the 'whole' export type Optimizing parallel operation Because it takes significantly less time to process a premium journal than when directly processingMicrosoft 365 mailboxes, it is worthwhile in every Microsoft 365 archiving use case to replace themethod of processing user mailboxes with a locally stored premium journal.A second less obvious advantage of premium journals is that Microsoft 365 is throttled the most.Due to this fact, all tests were performed with three workers, a selection variable of 250, aprocessing variable of 25 and internal list lengths of 50 (write) and 100 (delete/move). These scalingvalues were therefore also used as standard parameters when creating new action trees in the ELOXC configuration. Tests with five workers, the selection variable 500, and the processing variable 100failed in the fourth user mailbox with the error type Server busy.Local Exchange servers allow for more flexibility. A test with a local premium journal, five workers,and these scaling parameters resulted in processing time of 416 seconds for the export type splitattachments, an item transfer rate of 2.4/s (plus 20 percent compared to test 40), and a datatransfer rate of 6355 KB/s (plus 26 percent compared to test 40).170 ELO XCWith the maximum of 10 workers, the processing time was 419 seconds compared to the defaultscaling parameters in test 40, which is not an improvement compared to 5 workers. This is mostlikely due to the performance limit of the ten-year-old ELO test server. The document transfer ratewith a processing time of 419 seconds is still about 67/s. If the whole export type is used, as in test34, Exchange becomes overloaded quite quickly. This results in the Server busy error and similarerrors.A workaround for the fast journaling method (without splitattachments) can be tested using theExchange IMAP interface. With the scaling factors in this test, the 1000 messages were assigned to10 workers and the deletion list was only sent to Exchange after processing all messages due to itssize:171 ELO XCThe processing time of 175 seconds has a significant impact on RAM usage, since ELO XC loads allmessages for IMAP into the main memory during selection. The item transfer rate is 5.7/s and thedata transfer rate is 9004 KB/s. Increasing the processing volume to 10000 journal messagesresults in a processing time of 1773 seconds; at ten times the volume, this is about ten times theduration plus ten times the volume of the other parameters (10000 items, 40000 documents,15,757,548 KB). Compared to the standard scaling values</s> 
<s>used in test 34, the item transfer rateincreases by 23 percent and the data transfer rate by 21 percent. Although these are good values,they are not among the top values achieved in all tests. The biggest advantage that journaling viaIMAP offers is the absence of EWS throttling. If you have the option to disable EWS throttlingcompletely, EWS is always the preferred method.Very large messages The majority of normal e-mails are smaller than 250 KB. If you frequently have to archive large e-mails, it is worthwhile to use journaling. The following tests were performed for 1000 messageswith a size of 1.6 MB (two attachments of 1.1 MB and 0.5 MB each). All three configurations wereagain tested with the export type whole.Failed test 1 With these scaling parameters, the messages could not be processed:172 ELO XCTest 41 aborted at approximately 450 items in the first user mailbox. This was caused by the Serverbusy error message and Exchange notifying the user not to try again for five minutes. This meansthat throttling was enabled. The problem was not that 75 messages of 1.6 MB each (3 workers withprocessing variable 25) were loaded. The error messages occurred on saving (50 messagesstacked).Failed tests 2 and 3 Here, the update list was reduced to 10 and the number of workers was reduced to 1, but test 41still failed to complete. The processing throttle configured in ELO XC should still be avoidedbecause in practice it is equally effective for large and small items. It should only be used inemergencies.The throttling settings of the service account were changed for this purpose. First, a policy wascreated:This policy was then assigned to a service account:After that, the Exchange server virtual machine was restarted.New-ThrottlingPolicy -name ELOxcThrottling -RCAMaxConcurrency Unlimited -EWSMaxConcurrency Unlimited NSet-ThrottlingPolicyAssociation -identity xcservice -ThrottlingPolicy ELOxcThrottling173 ELO XCIn the third attempt, about 650 messages were processed in the first mailbox, 450 in the second,and only 150 in the last two mailboxes. However, the pattern of errors changed. The errormessages in Exchange changed to The operation has timed out or Internal server error.Disabling throttling for xcservice was clearly not enough.Successful test It was only possible to process the messages in full and without errors in test 41 after applying thesame throttling settings for the mailboxes.The selection variable was maximized because only a small amount of data is transferred in theprocess (essentially item IDs). The processing variable of a worker was reduced to 20. Batch writewas disabled because it seems likely that throttling takes place in the Exchange web frontend Internet Information Service (IIS). So instead of sending batches of about 16 MB to Exchange,individual messages as large as 1.6 MB were stored, which unfortunately also affected processingperformance. The differences between processing user mailboxes and journaling became clearlyevident in the comparison between test 41 and test 42.Configurations 2 and 3 were tested with 3 workers and these parameters:Get-Mailbox <mbx_filter> | Set-mailbox -ThrottlingPolicy ELOxcThrottling174 ELO XCAll 1000 mailbox items were once again selected. Configuration 2 simultaneously loaded 75 itemsfrom Exchange (120 MB), while configuration 3 retrieved</s> 
<s>twice that number for processing. Sinceneither configuration writes back items, the only relevant parameter is the deletion list. Messagesnot are transferred during the deletion process (hence the message size is irrelevant); only theempty item IDs are transferred. The size difference means that there is no significant effect on IIS,with or without throttling. Exchange can read large amounts of data within a short time.Results for very large messages While the data transfer rate was 2 MB/s in test 33, it is almost 15 MB/s in test 45. This shows thatthe ELO Indexserver is well-equipped for large data volumes, while the main task of ELO XCoptimization is to activate as much of the Exchange performance reserves as possible by means ofthe configuration.175 ELO XCIt should be noted, however, that changing the Exchange throttling settings can have significantconsequences. For example, the trade-off for processing messages in record time in ELO XC is thatExchange users will encounter mailbox access latency. Although the throttling settings can bereverted at any time by setting the global default policy for Exchange, these kinds of changes tothe configuration should still be done step-by-step and with the help of the on-site Exchangeadministrator to ensure that the optimization is successful.Conclusion Journaling offers higher archiving performance on average than processing user mailboxesindividually. This is already evident in on-premises Exchange servers (approx. 30 percent higherperformance for the whole export type), but the comparison between user mailboxes in Microsoft365 and on-premises premium journals results in two to three times higher performance evenwithout environment scaling.A key factor that affects all archiving methods is the total number of write operations. With IMAP,messages cannot be changed, but requires copies of whole messages when changes are made.EWS, on the other hand, generates higher costs for write operations than for read operations whenthe load quota is calculated to enforce throttling settings. You should therefore always considerwhether write operations are absolutely necessary. This should only rarely be the case in journalmailboxes.Mailbox emulation offers higher performance than directly processing user mailboxes.Configurations or convenience functions designed to support users are always associated with highcosts because of the write operations involved. This is particularly noticeable in the case of verylarge messages, which requires significant changes to the Exchange configuration as a result ofthese costs.In scenarios with varying data (with/without attachments, small/large messages), it is worthallocating messages to different groups to be processed by separate action trees with differentscaling values. While very small messages (less than 100 KB) may not cause any problems with anupdate list value of 50, it is safe to assume that this batch size will not work for messages largerthan 1 MB. Separating the action trees by message size is a good solution to the optimizationproblem.Exchange costs can roughly be broken down as follows:Read LowWrite HighDelete Very lowMove Very low176 ELO XC Table of contents Practice Log files Settings Log lines Individual log outputs Isolation Manual compilation Automatic compilation Troubleshooting Folder determination Show properties Very large messages Exchange EWS Catalog test with PowerShell Wildcard SharedMailbox Wildcard and SharedMailbox Mailbox selection</s>

<s>ELO Integration Client | BasicsELO Integration ClientBasicsTable of contentsELO Integration ClientGeneral 2 ELO Integration ClientELO Integration ClientGeneral Basic range of functions The client is a root entry from the ELO repository depending on the parameters and configuration. Adocument view component is used. If the root entry is a folder, users can navigate within thisfolder and view all child entries of the folder.A number of ELO functions are available for the current entry depending on the configuration. Userscan search for entries from ELO (including outside of the root entry) to create a reference toindividual search results within the root entry.Document view The document view is a standard component of the ELO Integration Client. It shows the content ofan entry, any configured ELO apps (e.g. Business Solution ELO Knowledge), the form (configurable),and the feed (configurable). The content is displayed depending on the entry. For folders, a list ofthe folder content (child entries) is shown, while different viewers are used to show documents,depending on their type (web viewer, e-mail viewer, text viewer, image viewer, WOPI viewer). Ifthe document has a preview document, it is also offered through an image viewer. If the documenthas full text, the text viewer is offered.Viewers Web viewer: Loads the document in an embedded iFrame. Different plug-ins are used todisplay the document depending on the browser and document type.E-mail viewer: e-mail files (.msg, .eml) are shown by the e-mail viewer. It requests thecontents of the e-mail from the server and displays them.Text viewer: the text contents of the file are displayed. In the viewer, you can change the fontsize.Image viewer: the contents of the file are queried and shown page by page as an image. Thisviewer allows you to switch between pages and scale the current image to different sizes.WOPI viewer: If you have installed the ELO Interface for Microsoft Office Online (ELOimo), thedocument preview can also show Office documents and PDF files using Microsoft OfficeOnline.Minimum requirements You will find the minimum requirements under ELO system requirements > ELO Integration Client.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO Integration Clienthttps://docs.elo.com/ops/requirements/en-us/overview/clients.html#elo-integration-clienthttps://docs.elo.com/ops/requirements/en-us/overview/clients.html#elo-integration-client Table of contents ELO Integration Client General Basic range of functions Document view Viewers Minimum requirements</s>

The clientgoes through a specific start-up procedure to enable the most flexible configuration possible.URL parameters The client responds to the following URL parameters (besides the standard parameters of an ELOapp):system=<system ID>: This parameter specifies the system the client has been integratedinto. Each client call requires this parameter. The value of this parameter is arbitrary, but anentry must be made for this value in the configuration.GUID=<GUID of the root entry>: [optional] This parameter indicates which entry should beused as the root entry. A GUID has to be entered; an object ID is not permitted.key=<group name of a field in the metadata>&value=<value of the field>: [optional]Instead of using a GUID from the parameter as a root entry, you can also perform a searchfor a field value (in the metadata) to find the root entry. An invoice with a specific invoicenumber could serve as a root entry as an example.In addition to these parameters, you can pass other processing parameters in an RF in the URL.These are then used later on during start-up.Default configuration The default configuration applies when starting the client. If a GUID parameter has been entered,this GUID is applied to the configuration.Repository configuration The client loads its ELO app repository configuration (elo.integration.Client.json) from therepository (under //Administration//ELO Apps//Configuration//). It contains a configuration for allrelevant system parameters. It is used depending on the value of the system parameter (system)and overrides the values from the default configuration (including any GUID parameter). If therepository configuration does not contain a value, the previous value is retained.Registered function If the value rFInit is set after reading the repository configuration, a registered function with thisname is called. The registered function receives all URL parameters allowing additional parametersto be processed here, depending on the integration system. This call expects a configuration objectthat overrides the previous configuration value.For example, a registered function could:Show/enable different functions depending on the user.Perform a repository search to determine the root entry as GUID.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 6 ELO Integration ClientInitiate a process that creates a new structure that will then be used as the root entry.Flows trigger You have the option to specify a flows trigger instead of a registered function. If you use a flowstrigger, you cannot specify a registered function. ELO Flows must be installed and there must be acomponent with a corresponding trigger (synchronous trigger with result). You can store the pathfrom the ELO Flows configuration here. It is possible to execute a trigger</s> 
<s>with multiple flows(automations) or a specific flow configured as a data query.ExamplesAutomations:"syncFlowInit": "api/v1/trigger/com.elo.bi.flows.component/IntegrationServiceSf/1.0/IcCallSf"Data queries:"syncFlowInit": "api/v1/trigger/com.elo.bi.flows.component/IntegrationServiceSf/1.0/IcCallSf?trigger=86696b32-a734-4aa9-9351-4d41d637b5b3"Index search If no GUID was set for the root entry during the previous start-up and if the URL parameters keyand value exist, a search for the specified value (value) is performed in a field (from the metadata)with the group name (key) and the first result is used as the root entry.Initialization The client loads the root entry, builds the function menu, and shows the entry; the client is thenoperational for the user. This concludes the start-up process.7 ELO Integration ClientSystem-specific integration You will find documentation on the system-specific installation of special modules with functionsthat go beyond the scope of the ELO Integration Client under:ELO for MicrosoftELO for SAP SolutionsELO for SalesforceELO for CASELO for abas ERPâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 8 ELO Integration Clienthttps://docs.elo.com/admin/elo-for-microsoft/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/elo-for-microsoft/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/sap-solutions/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/sap-solutions/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/salesforce/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/salesforce/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/cas/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/cas/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/abas/en-us/https://docs.elo.com/admin/abas/en-us/Known issues Bootstrap Glyphicons The integrated Internet Explorer in Navision 2015 was unable to load the font for the BootstrapGlyphicons in some cases.

The base package contains standardized package items. You can customizethis base standard and expand it with additional levels. Specific inheritance strategies in the basepackages allow ELO to install updates easily.Levels are a concept for configuring modifications, e.g.Â between test systems/production systemsor for customer-specific topics. The respective levels are always created in a specified package.Example A partner uses a custom level in an ELO solution package to make a series of modifications for acustomer. If there is an update for the ELO solution, it can be installed without difficulty becausethe ELO export package only contains the base level and only replaces this when imported. Thecustom level remains untouched in the customer system along with all custom modifications.Level structure Each package has a base</s> 
<s>level with standard ELO elements. You can also add more levels andcustomize them.8 ELO packagesThe respective levels are executed hierarchically. The levels are assigned integer values whichdetermine their position in the hierarchy.Configuration The highest associated level available is always used for a configuration.To allow you to overwrite the configurations as required, these must be split up into suitableobjects. This applies especially to configurations in the Config service,Â e.g. the views of forms orthe configurations of workspaces. There are initially no plans to allow for the overwriting of individual configurations in data managedby the ELO Indexserver. Only additional complete objects can be added on higher levels here(metadata forms, aspects, font colors, usersâ€¦). The inheritance function provides an option formodifying metadata forms.Example In contract management, there is a setting for when a user should be notified of an upcomingautomatic extension of a rental contract with a set durationÂ (e.g. cell phone contract). The defaultsetting (Level 100/Base) is 30 days. For a customer with slower business processes, the partner canset a value of 60 days in the level 500/Custom.When the system later creates the scheduled notifications, it sees the value 60 since it is in thehigher level, and the customer-side user receives the notification 60 days before the extension ofthe contract.9 ELO packagesAdd a new level Open a package in which you would like to adjust the levels.Click Add level.Enter the metadata for the new level.10 ELO packagesIn the Level drop-down menu, select a level.Enter a name for the new level in the Name field.Click Apply to confirm the change.Level metadata Level:An integer value indicates the level. The values currently in use are 100, 500, 900 (seebelow). The higher the number, the higher the level, which effectively hides similar settingsof the lower levels.Name:The name (DisplayName) shows the level in the package overview. Full Unicode is allowedexcept for pilcrows.Example For the customer XYZ Inc. the overseeing partner creates a Custom level (level 500) in the ELOinvoice package. They name it XYZ Inc..The following levels are currently planned: Name Level ExamplesBase 100 ELO standard metadata forms; ELOinvoice solutionCustom 500 Sample companyStaging 900 Paths in the test system; paths in the production system11 ELO packagesAssign content to a new level Click in the level display to select the level you would like to edit.To add metadata forms, aspects, groups, keyword lists, workspace types, teamspacetemplates, font colors, flows, and translations, click the respective field in the level.Alternative: Select the desired menu item in the menu bar.The selected menu item opens automatically, and you can generate new contentsÂ (e.g. addmetadata forms).

A package contains all theconfigurations required for a purpose.The levels concept allows you to manage and update customizations separately from the defaultconfiguration.ELO packages make it easier to transmit data from one system to another.3 ELO packagesMetadata forms and aspects Metadata are an essential part of the packages. They are represented by metadata forms andaspects.Metadata forms allow you to classify ELO objects by different types. Metadata forms are theframework that hold the aspects and fields together.Metadata forms are made up of aspects. Aspects represent the basic properties of an object in ELO.Aspects are divided into fields that contain the actual metadata and can link to other metadataforms.4 ELO packagesFirst steps To ensure that your packages are successfully implemented, it helps to consider certain thingsbefore you start creating them.The following steps provide a guide.Define goals and usage contextWhat do you primarily want to map?What is the package called?What is the usage context of the package?Transfer/deployment of an ELO Business SolutionBasic solutionCustomer-side modificationsBasis for transferring ELO from the partner to the customerBasis for staging transfer: development system, test system, production systemShould the package be made available in multiple languages?Plan groups and permissionsWhich people in the system are stakeholders in the package?Who is allowed to/must access what?Are there external stakeholders?Which roles are in place?Plan aspects and fieldsWhich aspects are required?Which aspects are required in different contexts?Which aspects are required multiple times in one metadata form?Do the aspect views need to different depending on the context?Which fields do the aspects require?Which data types do the fields require?Which keyword lists are required?Plan metadata formsIn which metadata forms can you meaningfully group aspects?Are there metadata forms that can be derived from other ones?What dependencies with other metadata forms are there?Which views for metadata forms are required?Planning automationWhere does automation make sense?â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â–ª â–ª â–ª â–ª â–ª â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ 5 ELO packagesWhich ELO modules can be used for automation?Plan spacesAre spaces needed for entire teams?Will the package be used for collaboration across teams?Which data aggregations are required?Which role needs which data?â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ 6 ELO packagesDefine goals and usage context Which data needs to be mapped depends largely on the requirements of the respective project andshould be discussed with the customer. You may find at this point that one package does not coverthe whole scenario.Example: Student administration This documentation explains how to implement a system for student administration in ELO.InformationOf course, the documentation cannot cover all aspects of student administration, so someaspects are only addressed superficially.The package in this example is intended to accomplish the following:Enter students with different characteristics.Assign students to faculties, departments, courses, and exams.The usage context is the completely new development of a</s> 
<s>basic solution.Since students from abroad can also enroll at the university, the solution should also belocalized into English.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 7 ELO packagesPlan groups and permissions Depending on the project, different users are involved. Whether they are people from the sameteam, the same company, or external stakeholders has a significant influence in terms of planningthe packages and the associated rights and permissions.You also need to determine which roles are required so that you can plan the rights concept.Example: Student administration In our example, the following groups of people can be identified:Student administration Head: Has the role of Administrator. Can see, create, edit, and delete all objects.Employees: Have the role of Employee. Can see, create, and edit all objects.Teaching staff Dean: Has the role of Faculty management. Can see, create, edit, and delete all objectsbelonging to their own faculty.Lecturers: Have the role of Lecturer. Can see and edit all objects belonging to their ownfaculty.Students: Have the role of Student. Can only see and edit their own objects.All persons are part of the system.Based on this information, we can create the following groups:Administrative managementAdministrative staffFaculty managementLecturersStudentsYou can learn how to create groups for a package under Groups.You can configure additional steps when planning the spaces and the corresponding roles.â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 8 ELO packagesPlan aspects and fields The objectives, the usage context, and the users in the package already provide initial indicationsof what the structure should be like.Analyze which data the users need for their roles. This will enable you to define the aspects andfields. You may also recognize possible dependencies with other data sets, and where there aresimilar data sets.Example: Student administration Administrative staff are the main users in the student administration system, but they focusprimarily on the students.For example, the following are some of the aspects that could be defined for students:PersonAddressesContact detailsFacultySubjectsCoursesSemesterStatusTicketsFeesYou can learn how to create these aspects in ELO under Metadata > Aspects > Create aspects.Since aspects are composed of fields, the next step would be to plan the fields and their data types.Here are some examples of possible aspects and fields:Aspect Fields Type OccurrencePerson First name Text in generalLast name Text in generalGender Selection listBirthday DateNationality Selection listAddress Street Text in generalHouse number Text in generalPostal code IntegerCity Text in generalCountry Selection listPhone Telephone number type Selection list Multiple timesâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 9 ELO packagesAspect Fields Type OccurrencePhone number IntegerE-mail E-mail address type Selection list Multiple timesE-mail address E-mail addressAffiliation Faculty Relation Multiple timesCourse RelationCourse Relationâ€¦You can use this kind of table to keep a record of the fields and field types you have defined.However, the table is just one method to help you plan. You should use the method that best suitsyour project.To learn how to create fields and get more information on field types, see Metadata > Aspects >Add fields.The table shows that the Selection list type is suitable for many fields, for example, if the numberof</s> 
<s>possible entries must be limited, and/or the values are required for other automated processes.You can learn how to create, edit, and manage keyword lists under Metadata > Keyword lists.You can derive other important points from the student aspects. For example, information aboutfaculties, subjects, courses, and exams is essential. We recommend using relations for this. Theseallow you to establish relationships with other data sets.You can find more information about relations in the documentation Configuration andadministration > Metadata forms and fields > Create field templates > Field types and under Configuration and administration > Metadata forms and fields > Metadata forms > Use.You may have already recognized that certain aspects are used in different contexts, and thatdifferent views are required. Given that each aspect requires at least one view, the creation ofviews is an important part of the planning process.For more information on creating views, see Metadata > Aspects > Create view for aspect.10 ELO packageshttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/metadata-forms-and-fields/field-types.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/metadata-forms-and-fields/field-types.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/metadata-forms-and-fields/field-types.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/metadata-forms-and-fields/creating-a-metadataform.html#ELODOC-524AF056365B4EA6B53F3BC380423442https://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/metadata-forms-and-fields/creating-a-metadataform.html#ELODOC-524AF056365B4EA6B53F3BC380423442Plan metadata forms Metadata forms are used to group aspects and fields in a way that enables you to classify objectsin the ELO system. Once you have defined the aspects and fields, it is easy to create the metadataforms.We recommend that you conduct an analysis and record the results so that you can identify anddocument possible dependencies between metadata forms and/or metadata forms and fields. Thismakes it easier to plan which metadata forms are based on other information.It also allows you to see which aspects need to be used multiple times in a metadata form.Inheritance and relations are important concepts. Inheritance enables you to apply aspects to othermetadata forms so that you only have to create them once. With relations, you can map wholedata sets to fields in other metadata forms.Depending on the user groups and roles as well as the different applications, you should also thinkabout what uses you will have for the metadata forms and which views you will need.You will find more information on creating, editing, and managing metadata forms under Metadata> Metadata forms.Example: Student administration In our example, we can derive the following metadata forms based on the information collected:StudentsFacultiesSubjectsClasses LabLectureSeminarTutorialâ€¦You could create a simplified overview of the metadata form in tables in the following way:Students Metadata form Usage Inheritance AspectsStudents Folder, documents, relation No PersonAddressesPhoneE-mailFacultyâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ 11 ELO packagesMetadata form Usage Inheritance AspectsCoursesSemesterStatusTicketsFeesFaculty Metadata form Usage Inheritance AspectsFaculty Folder, relation Basic data (title, building)Person (management)Person (deputy)Subject Metadata form Usage Inheritance AspectsSubject Folder, relation Basic data (title, building)Person (management)Person (deputy)Course Metadata form Usage Inheritance AspectsCourse Folder, relation For multiple subtypes Basic data (title, description)Person (instructor)RoomScheduleThe Course metadata form acts as a parent category for all courses.

You can create as many entriesas you want here. Due to their complexity, objects are split into multiple areas:General settingsStructure and metadata matchingâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 6 ELO for SAP SolutionsAssignment of user and group rights When performing calls, the system always checks from top to bottom. For example, if a certainobject (such as 17 for sales order) is configured first, followed by a wildcard with a regularexpression, the first entry is used when performing a call with object 17. For this reason, you shouldmake sure to sort entries from specific to general (corresponding buttons).Default filing path Object type: In the Object type column, enter the number of the respective object type in SAPBusiness OneÂ®.A general filing path is configured as standard. This path uses the wildcard character .* (period andasterisk) in the Object type column. The option is RegEx is also enabled. This path handles allobject types that do not have a more specific configuration.Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that mayhave to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column, e,g. SBO-Folder.Document form: Reserved for future use cases. The same form should be entered here as in theELO Integration Client configuration file.7 ELO for SAP SolutionsStructure and metadata matching Repository path: The filing path is defined in the Repository path column. With Handlebars syntax,you can use variables from SAP Business OneÂ® that are defined for transfer in the advancedconfiguration.ELO field matching: This is where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata formdefined under Folder form. In our example, this is the form SBO-Folder.Key field: You can select a key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a property of theobject that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example, you canspecify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. This ensures that an object is not created twice(with a new name) in the repository, for example. Instead, the corresponding folder is found and anew path is created according to the new name. The folder and its contents are moved to this newpath. The documents that were stored under the old name remain in the folder with the new name.Add entry: If necessary, you can add fields. You can enter additional variables with Handlebarssyntax or a static string without additional syntax.The fields have to be part of the metadata form and are not created automatically.

SAPÂ® Cloud for Customer groups multiple functional levels. This integration works forSAP Sales Cloud as well as SAP Service Cloud.The integration service provides the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Clientin an SAPÂ® Cloud for Customer system (referred to here simply as C4C). Following installation, theELO Integration Client is available as a mashup in correspondingly configured objects in the C4Cclient. When the ELO Integration Client is called within C4C, a configurable path is created(assuming one doesn't already exist) and displayed in ELO. This provides the user with thefunctions of the ELO Integration Client, which can also be customized if required.ELO basics To use the ELO Integration Service for SAPÂ® Cloud for Customer and the ELO Integration Clientwithin C4C, the systems must meet the following requirements:ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 or higherThe following modules are required: ELOwf ELOwf 20.05.000ELOwf 12.06.000ELO REST ELO REST Service 20.02.000ELO REST API 12.04.000ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.07.000 or higherCorrectly set SameSite flag (see ELO Integration Client documentation)Installed and configured ELOauth plug-in (optional when using single sign-on)In addition, your ELO license must include the ELO Integration Service for SAPÂ® Cloud for Customeras well as user licenses for the ELO Integration Client.Mashup basics A mashup is a website or application that integrates data or functionalities from two or moresources.In this case, C4C is the data source and the ELO Integration Client delivers the additionalfunctionality.

Youcan leave this field blank to use the default SAP system.21 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Function module: The name of the function module in SAP for which the mapping is beingperformed. It must be RFC-enabled.Commit: Only a database commit writes the data created or changed by a transactional functionmodule to the database. Not every function module performs the commit. In this case, you need toenable the option to explicitly perform a commit. If in doubt, refer to the SAP documentation for thefunction module in question to find out whether it performs a commit.Throw BAPIRET error: If the exporting or tables parameters contain the data type BAPIRET, thesystem checks for errors and forwards them. This function simplifies error handling.Queue: If this option is enabled, execution of the function module is processed via the ELO SmartLink queue. This can reduce the load on the system for mappings that are executed frequently andmakes it easier to trace Q entries.Prepare RF for response (*): Enter a registered ELO Indexserver function to process the response.Normally, the supplied function RF_erp_sap_conn_service_WriteBack will suffice.Preprocessing IX function (*): An ELO Indexserver function that returns an object with data, forexample to perform conversions or to collect data if these actions cannot be implemented withmapping alone.

You cannot save any changes during this time. Youshould only continue processing once all fields have been successfully loaded.This example can be found in the Invoice SAP template as invoicePostFI.Fig.: Completed configuration interface after successful loadingInformationIf the contents of the table remain empty after clicking the Load button, this can havevarious causes. In each case, check the connection parameters in the connectivity.configfile, the settings in ELO Smart Link, and check that the required ELO Business Solutionsversion is installed. Another cause could be that there are missing permissions in therespective SAP system.Clicking on the individual parameters (e.g. DOCUMENTHEADER) opens the configuration formapping the selected entry.The three types used for communication with the interface parameter types and that build on eachother are explained below:Elementary type: This type is a simple value and behaves like a single field in a table.Structure: In the SAP environment, a (flat) structure is a data type that is comparable to a singlerow in a database table. A structure can contain any number of columns. In this context, we alsorefer to fields instead of columns.Table: Unlike structures, table types can contain any number of rows. A table type always has astructure as a line type.23 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Interface parameter types Fig.: Configuration interface, mappingThere are four types of interface parameters that can be used:Import: An import parameter can only be passed to the function module. All three types can bepassed here: elementary types, structures, and tables.Export: The contents of an export parameter are available if the function module ended withouterrors. Export parameters are only returned to ELO. You can use the same types as for import.Changing: These parameters are both import and export parameters and, like these, can alsoconsist of all three types. A changing parameter can therefore be transferred and requested. Beforethe function module is called, the changing parameter behaves like an import parameter. When thecall is</s> 
<s>complete, the changing parameter acts as an export parameter.Tables: This parameter only allows tables as types. Like changing parameters, these can betransferred and requested.After selecting a specific parameter, the components corresponding to the type appear, which cannow be assigned to the ELO fields or requested for the advanced data transfer.Transfer/Request: If this field is enabled, the values are transferred to the corresponding fields.24 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If Transfer was selected, values are transferred to the SAP system. With Request, the SAP systemtransfers the data to ELO.You can only enable Transfer for import parameters. Request is only allowed for export parameters.Both actions are allowed for tables. In the SAP context, however, it is common practice to usetables either as an import or as an export.Type: The ELO field type. As tables consist of structures, and structures consist of elements andcounting structure elements, the types that can be selected depend only on whether the end resultis an element or a counting structure element. The type determines what you can enter in the Value field. This is explained below.There are two types of counting structure elements:MAPLOOP: The value entered represents an ELO map field, which automatically runs througha loop. If you enter a map field name such as POS here, the function assumes that a mapfield with the name POS exists. In this case, the number following POS counts upwards untilthe map field with the name no longer exists. Elements that follow a counting structureelement can have the entry {I}, for which the number of the loop iteration is then used. Forexample, for a map field with the name VALUE1 VALUE2 etc., you only need to set VALUE{I}.OBJ_PROP_LOOP: This counter structure element is used to transfer a self-defined object. Fora detailed explanation, see Preprocessing IX function in the section Create function modulemapping You can see the structure of the JSON object that is passed in the script erp.sap.invoice.ix.GetPostingLines. preObj is always the object returned by the IX function forpreprocessing. This object can have any number of attributes that can be addressed usingHandlebars syntax. An example of this is the invoicePostFI function in the erp.sap.Invoice(Invoice SAP template) package. Here, preObj.accountgl is specified as the counter structureelement for the table ACCOUNTGL. Therefore, preObj.accountgl provides access to multipleattributes, which are now used for iteration. All objects that have been passed through aretransferred to the subsequent elements via Handlebars. For the element ACCOUNTGL-ITEMNO_ACC, for example, the entry defined with the following expression is transferred:The field type must be HTMPL. With preObj.accountgl, you address the array of objects, thefollowing entry {I} defines the index of the current loop iteration, and itemno_acc points to theattribute of the object, which is ultimately transferred.There are four types of elements that can be transferred. In principle, it is possible to transferelements in both directions (ELO to SAP and SAP to ELO). The transfer direction from ELO to the SAPsystem is described below.GRP: This is where you define the name of the field from the ELO metadata</s> 
<s>form from whichthe value is read.HTMPL: HTMPL stands for Handlebars template (see section Handlebars syntax).MAP: An ELO map field is used as the source.â€¢ â€¢ {{{preObj.accountgl.{I}.itemno_acc}}}â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 25 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)FIX: The value stored here is transferred. The field can also contain an {I} in the loop context.Value: The value that is entered here depends on the selected types. Possible entries arealready defined under Type.InformationThe placeholder {i} can be used on the end for the line number, in this case with a capital"I".Advanced data transfer The next area of the configuration interface is reserved for advanced data transfer from the SAPsystem. At this point, you have two possible options for advanced data transfer.Handlebars syntax Handlebars is a template engine that dynamically generates character strings. It uses a specialsyntax to manipulate and convert input values, sometimes with the help of conditional branching("if/else"). An output rule always consists of a character string, known as the Handlebars string.Official information on Handlebars syntax can be found on the website handlebarsjs.com.In addition to the standard Handlebars functionality, there are some helper functions available.InformationYou will find a list of the available helper functions on the ELO SupportWeb in thedocumentation on the class sol.common.Template in the Business Solutions Commonpackage.Fig.: Configuration interface, HandlebarsHandlebars syntax allows you to write the response from the SAP system to ELO fields. This can beused to concatenate or split fields, for example. The required values must be requested in theparameter mapping, but do not require a mapping there.26 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)https://handlebarsjs.com/https://handlebarsjs.com/An example of advanced data transfer using Handlebars syntax:Fig.: Configuration interface, Handlebars syntaxField name: INVOICE_NO_ERPField type: ELO fieldHandlebars string:Field name: SAP_OPEN_ITEM_DOCField type: MAP fieldHandlebars string:Field name: SAP_OPEN_ITEM_YEARField type: MAP fieldHandlebars string:In the above example, a response from the SAP system is converted, addressing the result object.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ {{substring result.E.OBJ_KEY 10 14}}{{substring result.E.OBJ_KEY 0 10}}{{substring result.E.OBJ_KEY 14 18}}â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ {{substring result.E.OBJ_KEY 0 10}}â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ {{substring result.E.OBJ_KEY 14 18}}27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Handlebars can also be used to transfer data from ELO to the SAP system. ELO fields can beaddressed with the convention sord.objKeys.<FIELDNAME>, whereas ELO map fields can beaddressed with sord.mapKeys.<FIELDNAME>. For more information, refer to the Business Solutionsdocumentation.Access to the result object is structured as follows:<paramtype> describes the parameter, in this case E for Export, C for Changing, andT for Table.Fig.: Advanced data transfer of the result object<parameter> corresponds to the name of the parameter of the SAP function module. In the aboveexample, it would be the export parameter with the name OBJ_TYPE.[.<key>] is only relevant if the parameter is either a structure or a table type. The field isaddressed according to the field name.[.pposition] is only relevant for table types. You can address a line of the table selected using <parameter>. Note that you must place the position in square brackets. The example for addressingthe second line of a table looks like this:SAP table values in MAP</s>

A secure permissions concept is therefore crucial. Export and use of SAP datain external systems, especially by users without an SAP account, can affect the SAP license of theconnected system. If in doubt, consult SAP and/or the responsible IT systems specialist. ELO is notliable for any license violations.Basics Using ELO Connectivity Pack â€“ Indexdownload requires customization of SAP ArchiveLink on theSAP system connected to ELO. Document types, document classes, a content repository, and linkentries have to be created for this purpose. An ELO ArchiveLink interface or ELO Smart Linkinterface with configured content repositories is also required.ELO Connectivity Pack â€“ Indexdownload must be configured in ELO Smart Link or ELO ArchiveLinkand the transport has to be imported into the corresponding SAP system. The configured SAP usermust have permission to run this function module (see the section SAP function module).To use the entire ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP, your computer must also meet the followingsystem requirements and release statuses of ELO and the SAP system:ELOprofessional/ELOenterprise version 10.02.000 and higherELO Business Solutions Common 1.05.002 and higherThe following SAP versions or higher: SAP_BASIS 702 SAPKB70213SAP_BASIS 730 SAPKB73009SAP_BASIS 731 SAPKB73106The following requirements have to be met to use the ELO Integration Client within the SAPsystem:ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 and higherDepending on the version, the following modules are required: ELO 20: ELOwf 20.05.000ELO REST Service 20.02.000ELO 12: â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â–ª â–ª â—¦ â–ª 3 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)ELOwf 12.06.000ELO REST API 12.04.000ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.07.000 or higherThe ELO license must also include the ELO Integration Client.â–ª â€¢ 4 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Installation A license for ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP ERP includes two functions: Indexdownload and Datatransfer.

ELO Connectivity Pack â€“ Indexdownloaduses new metadata forms and fields created in ELO with SAP attribute names. For more informationon the SAP attribute names, refer to the section '/ELO/BO_FIELDS' transaction.This data can vary depending on the business object and possibly the release versions. Table data(e.g. on order items) is also offered. When used in a field, it is listed separated by pilcrowcharacters (Â¶).Metadata forms in ELO ELO Connectivity Pack â€“ Indexdownload contains three new metadata forms specifically for an SAPbusiness object: an SAP folder form, the new SAPDATA form, and a template form that ELOBusiness Partners can use as a basis for customizing metadata forms. By default, these metadataforms are defined for the Everyone permissions group. The ELO Business Partner has to make anynecessary changes based on the existing permissions concept.SAP-PurchaseOrder â€“ business object BUS2012 The SAP-PurchaseOrder metadata form was defined to index</s>

The same metadata form as the one in theELO Smart Link or ELO ArchiveLink configuration must be entered here.Metadata field to check whether the index has already been downloaded: Check for downloadingthe index again (button).Restrict to user group: Here, you can enable the button to download an index (see chapter the Additional functions) for a specific user group. If the field is left blank, all ELO users can use thebutton.Clear all fields before re-downloading that are not required to link the document to SAP: This meansthat the index fields (besides the ArchiveLink system fields) are cleared before the index is20 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)downloaded for a document again. If this function is disabled, the metadata are continuously addedto the fields.View in expert mode SAP document link fields: List of all default SAP ArchiveLink fields that are not cleared when theoption above is selected.Configuration â€“ Structure and rights In the following area, you can create different scenarios, e.g. for setting up a structure or assigningpermissions.21 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Move actions Metadata fields for determining the name In the first part of the Structure and rights configuration interface, you can configure the fields thatare used to determine names.Metadata fields: The short name of the document is generated based on these entries. The fieldsentered here are checked. If the first field is blank, the second field is checked, etc. By default, the SAP_DESCR field contains a field from the SAP table TOAAT (description).Template for determining the new path In the second area, you can create a new document path using Handlebar syntax. You can use thefields configured in SAPDATA for this. It is also possible to move the documents to the SAP path atthis point and, after successfully changing the metadata form and downloading a new index, createa structure with your own scripts. See also the chapter Process.22 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Path (Handlebars support): Path for building the folder structure based on field values of the form SAPDATA.Mandatory fields (in the path; also used for the search): If you have defined mandatory fields in thepath, enter them here. ELO creates the folder structure based on these fields.Form change (document) The next step is to change the metadata form. At this point, you can specify which metadata fieldsand values to assign to the desired metadata form.Metadata field and value assignment to form: Each metadata field in the default form SAPDATA canbe used to change forms</s> 
<s>in order to assign documents not only new forms but also new fields.Recommendation: Set a metadata form for an SAP business object or document type.When you change the form, the index is downloaded again, as the new form may contain or useother fields.Folder form Form name: The form assigned to the bottom folder of the new structure can be defined here. Thisfolder only contains documents. By default, ELO uses the SAP-Folder form.If the Expert mode field under the menu is selected, two additional menu items appear.23 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Update short name: If this option is enabled, the Path (Handlebars support) setting is interpreteddifferently. The last entry is no longer used to set the path, but instead defines the short name ofthe item to be filed.Example with template path:The OBJECT_ID has the value 450001000.Previously, the document was filed to the SAPÂ¶OrdersÂ¶450001000 structure. By enabling theoption, the document is now filed to the SAPÂ¶Orders structure and is assigned the value 450001000as its short name. If you want to keep the previous structure when enabling this option, you willhave to add an element to the template path. The example would then look like this:The result: The document would be filed to SAPÂ¶OrdersÂ¶450001000 as before, but also assigned theshort name 450001000.It is also possible to initiate this via an event type linkage in the SAP system.Update repository path: This function can be used to configure whether the short name is checkedand modified on document storage and the subsequent index download, and whether it is modifiedand moved if there is new metadata. It is also possible to initiate this via an event type linkage inthe SAP system.Apply metadata from document: Defines the fields from the first document of the respective folderwhich are then applied to the SAP-Folder form defined above.InformationSAPÂ¶OrdersÂ¶{{{sord.objKeys.OBJECT_ID}}}SAPÂ¶OrdersÂ¶{{{sord.objKeys.OBJECT_ID}}}Â¶{{{sord.objKeys.OBJECT_ID}}}24 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The AR_OBJECT (document type) field is required for future developments. This field is leftblank in the current configuration.InformationIf you make any adjustments to the configuration or script, you need to restart the ELOIndexserver and ELO Automation Services Tomcat services.Assignment of user and group rights In this area, you can assign user and group rights to a document or its structure based on specificvalues.Document: If the box is checked, the rights are set for the document.Structure: If this box is checked, the rights are assigned to the folder structure in which thedocument is stored.

Example text for an SAP object:Rules and matches Metadata field: Enter the technical name of the metadata field to be checked here.Value: Enter the value here that is compared with and must match the value in the specifiedmetadata field to create the template structure. If the values match, the structure configured under Path to template is created.RegEx: If you want to use a regular expression in the Value field, you must check this box. Theconvention for the regular expression is without slashes. Example: BUS201[0,2] would result inmatches with the values BUS2010 and BUS2012.Path to template: Enter the path to the template structure here. For example, if you created atemplate structure PurchaseOrder, this would mean that when you file a corresponding document,the structure is created at the following path provided all the conditions are met:Administration // Business Solutions Custom // erp.sap.indexdownload // Configuration //FolderTemplates // PurchaseOrderAt this point, you can use a separator to define a deeper folder structure. However, the separatorused must be leading, e.Â g. if you enter /Vendor/Orders, the slash is recognized as a separator.Handlebars syntax is also allowed, which enables you to control templates flexibly.If you use Handlebars syntax to create the structure, you can only use metadata from the fields ofthe initial template, in most cases SAPDATA. If more information is required at this point than isavailable in the default system, the form SAPDATA and the index download need to be customized.Example27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The system checks the field SAP-OBJECT for the contents BUS2010 and BUS2012. If this condition ismet, the corresponding template structure is created from the following path:In this case it is the structure below /BUS2010 or /BUS2012, as defined</s> 
<s>by the rule.Assignment of documents in the template structure There is another function that allows you to store documents (e.g. by document type) in childdirectories based on rules. You can create these directories using the template structure. If aspecified child directory does not exist within the template structure, it is created.Metadata field: The technical name of the metadata field to be checked is entered here.Value: Enter the value to be compared in the specified metadata field here. If there is a match, thetemplate structure of the defined subpath is created, see below.RegEx: If you want to use a regular expression in the Value field, you must check this box. Theconvention for the regular expression is without slashes. Example: BUS201[0,2] would result inmatches with the values BUS2010 and BUS2012.Subpath: The subpath defined here is based on the path of the template structure. Again, the firstcharacter to be defined is the separator. You can specify any depth, and also use Handlebarssyntax. If the path does not exist, the structure is created./{{{sord.objKeys.SAP\_OBJECT}}}28 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Process After filing a document from SAP, initially only the standard information such as SAPPATH (SAPArchivepath) or SAPCRDATA (SAP Creation Date) is stored. Here are two possible scenarios of howyou can automate the index download:With the configuration setting in ELO Smart Link. You will find details in the configurationdocumentation of ELO Smart Link for SAPÂ® ERP.With event linkage from the SAP system. This function is also used, for example, in the ELOIntegration Client environment to obtain metadata from the SAP system and build structuresin ELO, which the ELO Integration Client requires. For more information, refer to the ELOToolbox for SAPÂ® ERP documentation. If the index download function is enabled in the configuration settings of ELO Smart Link, there is asystem delay until the index is download. The download interval can be set in the ELO Smart Linkconfiguration.The function module in SAP is now contacted and an initial index download is performed based onthe standard information. As the SAP function module can identify the referenced document in SAPbased on SAPPATH, it returns all available index values to ELO. Based on the metadata fields thathave the same attribute names in SAP, ELO can now complete the required metadata fields (e.g. SAP_OBJECT or OBJECT_ID).If the function Move enabled is selected, the data is transferred to the ELO structure via an ELOasscript based on the metadata fields in the form SAPDATA. In addition, the template structure iscreated if the configuration is stored. The defined permissions in the configuration are also set. Thenext step is to change the metadata form, if configured.Informationâ€¢ â€¢ 29 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)file:///builds/documentation/admin/integrations/suite-sap-al/.temp/elo-toolbox-for-sapfile:///builds/documentation/admin/integrations/suite-sap-al/.temp/elo-toolbox-for-sapThe structure is based on the data from the first index download. If additional or differentfields are required to create the structure, these can be added in the base form (SAPDATA).After the new form has been selected, a second index download is performed and the availablemetadata fields of the new form are completed. The</s> 
<s>index download also uses the same SAPattribute names here.InformationIf you only want to change the metadata form, you can modify the corresponding script sothat a dummy path (SAP) is used instead of the chaos folder, forÂ example.30 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Additional functions 'Indexdownload' button You will find the Indexdownload button on the new SAP tab. Click this button to download the indexof the selected documents again. Depending on the configuration, the current metadata values areeither deleted or retained. The values are separated with a semicolon.The function checks whether the selected documents have a reference to the SAP system andwhether they have already been indexed. If either of the two cases applies, these documents arelisted:You now have the option to abort the process or continue. Another dialog box appears, which eitherconfirms the process was successful or lists all documents for which the index download was notcompleted.Please note31 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The index download requires a certain amount of time for indexing. During this time, do notlock any documents that you are performing the index download on. In addition, when usinga manual index download, you should limit the number of documents, otherwise the processmay take a long time and can cause the Indexserver process to abort. We recommendselecting no more than 500 entries.ELO Connectivity Pack â€’ Indexdownload extensions If you would like to add more fields or implement an existing development to exchange data, youcan create an extension for ELO Connectivity Pack â€“ Indexdownload. ELO only recommends thisoption if you have extensive knowledge of SAP-ABAP programming.Create class Create a new class (e.g. ZCL_EXT_KEY_EXPORT) in the transaction SE24.Enter the description and confirm with Save.32 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Enter the desired/required package.Select the desired transport order or create a new one.On the Interfaces tab, you can now enter the /ELO/IF_EXTEND_KEY_EXPORT interface.Next, you have to implement the two methods on the Methods tab.The /ELO/IF_EXTEND_KEY_EXPORT~GET_KEYS method is called following standard processingwhen downloading an index. Here, you can add fields and values or replace the entirecontent. The IV_TOA import parameter is assigned the entry from the link table (e.g.contentÂ repository, document ID, SAP object, object ID, etc.). The CT_KEYTAB changingparameter contains the completed value pair tables.33 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)This figure shows an implementation example that deletes all default values and calls animplemented function module.In addition, the name and descriptions of possible fields for the implementation should bemaintained in the /ELO/IF_EXTEND_KEY_EXPORT~GET_POSSIBLE_FIELDS method.34 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The figure shows an implementation for the case that the called function module from theprevious example only returns one field named DATEDOCUMENT for the BKPF businessobject.Implementation example An implementation example that can be used is available in the /ELO/CL_KE_EXT_BKPF class.

Our exampleonly refers to system 4 if the object type is BUS2012 and the role ZICELO_4 was added in theuser's master record.If no results are found, a check is performed to determine whether an entry with theavailable object type and role exists. Therefore, all users who do not have the role ZICELO_4for the object type BUS2012 are forwarded to system 3.If there is no match here either, a search is performed for a result for the object type * andthe suitable role, and therefore, the user is forwarded to system 2 if the user has the role ZICELO_2, independently of the object type.A default entry should be created so that a destination can be referred to if there is no match,in this example system 1.Event-based structure For the ELO Integration Client to have a starting point to display the structure within an SAP object,it requires a structure built based on SAP business object information. See also the documentationfor ELO Toolbox for SAPÂ® ERP.This structure can also be used so that it builds on SAP events. Creating the same structures (e.g. apurchase file) in ELO when creating an order in the SAP system, for example, does not require theELO Integration Client in this case.InformationYou can start background jobs with an event. An event is a signal to the background controlthat a certain status has been reached in the system. The background control then starts alljobs waiting for this event. ForÂ example, you can start an external program in thebackground with this event.Even if you don't want to use the ELO Integration Client, the event-based structure also requires theconfigurations from the section Using the ELO Integration Client within the SAP system.The events to be used also have to be implemented/triggered (thrown) within an SAP system. Ifsuch an event occurs, a process is started via the receiver function module /ELO/SEND_KEYS_FROM_BO. The configuration of the Indexdownload function is used. If a structure was40 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)defined within the indexdownload.config file or the folder template is used for the correspondingSAP business object (see section Assignment of template structures), the defined structures arecreated in ELO.Implementation example for event-controlled structure creation In the following example implementation, we use the event Order created to create a defined orderfile from the folder template.In the first step, you have to identify the event you want to use within the SAP system.Call the desired SAP business object using SAP transaction SWO1 and then open the Eventsmenu item.For SAP business object BUS2012, there is the event PurchaseOrder.created, which triggers anew order on creation.In the next step, an event type linkage has to be created for this</s>

In this case,you can create a Z business object to define the desired event. However, you should only dothis if you have extensive knowledge of SAP.Automatic metadata update The event type linkage can also be used to update metadata for a document already stored in ELO,for example if you want to update the metadata after changing an order. A new index download isperformed for all documents of the corresponding SAP business object.This event type linkage can also be used to download metadata after successfully linking a barcodevia the barcode upload function.Developed for this purpose, the function module /ELO/TRIGGER_DOWNLOAD is part of theinstallation packages and the corresponding SAP transport.Implementation example for updating metadata As in the example for creating a structure (see section Implementation example for event-controlled structure creation), a relevant event has to be identified to update the metadata.As described, you can use the SAP transaction SWO1 for the corresponding object.1. 43 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)In the next step, you create the event type linkage for the identified event.Go to SAP transaction SWETYPV and create a new event type linkage.

All information relating to Datatransfer about supported versions ofSAPÂ® ERP or ELO, the configuration (especially searchHelps.config and functionModuleMappings.config), and technical functionality or restrictions, applies equally toTemplate Invoice. Refer to the corresponding documentation in the ELO SupportWeb.Template Invoice is essentially an extension of Business Solution ELO Invoice (referred to here asELO Invoice) whose main function is to enable users to capture invoices in ELO and transfer them inthe context of SAPÂ® ERP.Template Invoice is an implementation example with a range of preconfigured modules that can beeasily reused in the implementation project. Due to the complexity of SAPÂ® ERP systems and theircustomizing and programmatic extension options as well as the individuality of businessprocesses, it may be necessary to make customer modifications to the basic configuration.3 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Requirements Dependencies As described in the Introduction, Template Invoice is based on ELO Invoice and uses Datatransferfunctionalities for interface communication. You must have obtained both components and testedtheir functionality before the installation. The associated requirements and dependencies for SAPÂ®ERP and ELO systems can be found in the corresponding documentation.This implementation has been tested for the following ELO versions and components:ELOprofessional/ELOenterprise version 10.02.000 or higherELO Invoice 1.08.000InformationYou need to take into account the dependencies of ELO Invoice in the aforementionedversion. ELO Invoice updates and upgrades are not implemented at the same time as thoseof Template Invoice. In terms of the Template Invoice version, make sure you have the validversion of ELO Invoice, since the latter need not be the current version. New versions of ELOInvoice are evaluated and only implemented where necessary in Template Invoice duringthe next update or upgrade.Security and licensing requirements The security and licensing requirements for ELO Invoice and ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERPapply. In particular, be aware of the possible implications for the SAPÂ® ERP license when usingTemplate Invoice with the Datatransfer functions as part of ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP.Basics The ability to process incoming invoices in SAP in the context of business transactions isdependent upon process integration between ELO and SAPÂ® ERP, which requires advancedcustomizing in the relevant SAP modules.InformationGeneral rule: A request to transfer or post incoming invoices in SAPÂ® ERP can only beexecuted if it can be manually posted with the corresponding SAP transaction. Conversely,the</s> 
<s>interface cannot implement a request if the invoice cannot be posted manually in SAP.Example: If customizing settings or master data are missing or incorrect (e.g. posting periodis not open or invalid GL account), posting would fail regardless of whether it is donethrough the interface or manually.â€¢ â€¢ 4 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Recommendation: Each posting variant in the target process should be manually verified inthe respective SAP transaction before attempting to post through the interface.5 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Installation Before installing Template Invoice, check the dependencies referred to in chapter Dependenciesand install if necessary.You will find the current installation file (ZIP folder) for Template Invoice on the ELO SupportWebunder:Integration > ELO for SAPÂ® ERP > ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® > ELO Connectivity Pack forSAPÂ® ERP > Download TemplatesOne component of this folder is an SAP transport that you need to import into the target system. Allthe .eloinst files must be installed in the ELO system in ascending order according to the numericalprefix in the file name.SAP transport Inform your customer or the SAP partner about the SAP transport to be installed and provide it tothem.InformationInform your customers or SAP partner of the following:The standard SAP transport routes must be used.All developments and functions within the transport were developed in a separate SAPnamespace, called /ELO/.You may have to enable the Ignore Invalid Component Version option when importing theSAP transport.It is also possible that you will encounter warnings when importing the transport due todifferent release statuses (return code 8), which can be ignored. The transport object listalso contains the class /ELO/CL_BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT as an activated implementation ofthe Business Add-In (BAdI) BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT. More technical details about this classare described in chapter BAdIs. Any existing implementations for the same BAdI need to bechecked for compatibility and modified if necessary.Once the SAP transport has been imported successfully into the SAP systems, the other requiredpackages can be installed.ELO installation packages The .eloinst files in the installation file must be installed in the following order:01_erp.sap.invoice_x.xx.xxx.eloinst91_custom_erp.sap.invoice_ x.xx.xxx.eloinstâ€¢ â€¢ 6 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)https://supportweb.elo.com/en-us/integration/elo-for-sapr-erp/elo-suite-for-sap-archivelinkr/elo-connectivity-pack-for-sapr-erp.htmlhttps://supportweb.elo.com/en-us/integration/elo-for-sapr-erp/elo-suite-for-sap-archivelinkr/elo-connectivity-pack-for-sapr-erp.html92_custom_sol.invoice_SAP_ x.xx.xxx.eloinstThe placeholder x.xx.xxx stands for the respective version number of Template Invoice.InformationThe .eloinst files also include an installation file, which is intended for the custom area ofthe package sol.invoice (ELO Invoice). When you install the package, all current settings inthis area will be overwritten.This applies generally for reinstalling a package in the same administration path and isespecially important for upgrades of Template Invoice or ELO Invoice.Installation information When installing Template Invoice, it is possible that the web apps for configuration files are notgenerated completely. You can tell that this is the case if there is no interface when you open theconfiguration.To fix this, go to the ELO Application Server and open the ELOwf status report. You will see theApp Manager entry in the menu bar on the right.In the ELO App Manager, the App status indicates whether the web app installation wassuccessful. If this is the case, the</s> 
<s>entry Installed is shown at the location. If it is set to Archived, you will have to enable/install, and refresh the web app.7 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Functionality Template Invoice is an implementation example of an extension of ELO Invoice designed to enablebidirectional communication with an SAP ERP system. One component of the main extension is thedirect integration of SAP search helps with form fields in ELO. This enables the user to executesearch helps with dynamic filter criteria according to the entries in a form field directly in SAP andto output the results in the form field using a dynamic keyword list (DnyKWL).In the context of processing incoming invoices, Template Invoice also shows how to load complexdata structures of SAP objects into ELO and generate transactional data in SAP from ELO using thefunction module mapping (Datatransfer).The search help and function module mappings provided with Template Invoice can be easilyadapted to customer requirements by changing the parameterization. Reusable workflowcomponents (subworkflows) make it easier to create custom ELO workflows.The following subchapters provide an overview of the Template Invoice components and explainwhat modifications have to be made to ELO Invoice. You must have basic knowledge of ELO Invoiceand the configuration and functionality of Datatransfer to understand the content.Forms All form customizations for Template Invoice are included as changes to the basic forms in thecustom area of ELO Invoice. Following installation, you can check all changes in the form designerunder sol_invoice.InformationYou can recognize modified forms and form modules by the corresponding icon.Not all form modules provided with ELO Invoice are modified by Template Invoice. Forexample, the fields in the compact item line view are not linked to the SAP search help. Itmay be necessary to adapt the required form modules to meet the customerâ€™srequirements.Dynamic keyword lists/search helps Most of the form customizations involve changing the dynamic keyword lists in existing formfields. Datatransfer enables direct integration with elementary SAP search helps. This eliminatesthe need to replicate master data or customizing objects, which are needed to enter data orvalidate a form, in an ELO database. Besides entailing less maintenance, this significantlyenhances data quality since inconsistencies and time delays are prevented. Since SAP alreadyprovides a large number of elementary search helps for various objects, you do not often need tocreate custom search helps.8 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Dynamic keyword lists that address SAP search helps can be recognized by the prefix erp.sap.invoice.ix.dynkwl, e.g. erp.sap.invoice.ix.dynkwl.CostCenter for cost centers.All search help mappings provided with Template Invoice can be viewed in the configuration file searchHelps.config under the administration path Business Solutions // erp.sap.invoice //Configuration. The result fields under Output or the filter fields used under Search usually allow youto determine the form field that is linked to the corresponding dynamic keyword list. Conversely,the search help mapping addressed by a form field can be recognized by the DynKWL script: Theidentifier following the aforementioned prefix is also the name of the mapping, e.g. the GL accountin the item lines (map field INVI_GL_ACCOUNT_NO)</s> 
<s>is linked to the DynKWL scripterp.sap.invoice.ix.dynkwl.AccountGl; the corresponding mapping is therefore called AccountGl.Besides helping you to enter data in a field, search help mappings can transfer additional columnsof the selected data set. For example, when selecting a tax code, the tax percentage returned bythe search help is automatically written to another form field (see also search help mapping TaxCodes).It is also possible to call search helps (or other DynKWL) dynamically from the form header script.For example, clicking Load purchase order items (Invoice data tab of the form, Orders area)executes the search help mapping PurchaseOrderItems, which reads the corresponding order itemsfrom SAP and transfers them to the invoice items in the form.New form elements To successfully post an invoice in SAP, you may require more than the data or available fields inELO Invoice. For this reason, Template Invoice adds fields to the forms that are typically necessaryfor the most common posting variants of an incoming invoice in SAP. In addition, completely newform areas were created to make it easier to process incoming invoices in the SAP context.The most important changes are summarized in the following list:Booking dateCredit note check box for entering vendor credit notesOne-time account (CpD) check box for posting to CpD accountsPayment block for open itemsForm area for payment terms: Payment terms can be loaded from SAP and, if required,modified in the form.Adding item lines for frequently used SAP fields, such as tax codes. Many of the item lineextensions in Template Invoice are not enabled (hidden) in the standard software. These areintended for special incoming invoice variants and can be enabled if necessary (see Multipleaccount assignment of purchase order items (MM)).SAP form tab: Display error messages when posting and tracking the document flow of openitems within SAP (parked/posted/balanced)â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 9 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Additional functionalities/header script All additional functionalities provided with Template Invoice are implemented in the integratedheader script. It can be viewed under the following administration path: Business Solutions //erp.sap.invoice // ELOwf Base // Webapp // erp.sap.invoice.forms.Invoice_JS.Please noteFor update purposes, it is important that you do not modify this file or replace it with a filefrom the custom area. If you need to do customizations, you should integrate them in theform header script using an additional include.The most important changes/additional functionalities are:Automatic enable/disable of the Credit note option depending on the selected documenttype. For details, see invoice.config â€“ AccountingExchange rates for foreign currencies are calculated based on the current rate and transferredwith the corresponding search help for currencies in SAP. The booking date is used as thecurrency conversion date. Changing the booking date triggers a new background query inSAP, which automatically adjusts the exchange rate.Clicking Load terms of payment executes a search help query of the terms of payment keyentered. The terms are transferred to the form where they can be changed by the user.Clicking Load purchase order items executes a search help query of the purchase order itemsentered. The loaded purchase order items are added to</s> 
<s>the item lines.Workflow Template Invoice provides a range of (sub)workflows that enable bidirectional communicationbetween ELO and SAP based on Datatransfer. The workflow prefix is always erp.sap.invoice. Thefollowing workflows (can also be used in custom workflows) are included:erp.sap.invoice.Base: Basic workflow that maps the entire document capture process;starting with automatic analysis (e.g. ELO DocXtractor) followed by multi-stage approval/release and error handling to posting and linking the SAP document. This workflow is a copyof sol.invoice.base of the ELO Invoice version used in each case; SAP data transfers areadded where appropriate.erp.sap.invoice.Download: Subworkflow for loading additional information about thedocument. In the current version, the module is only used for automatically loading purchaseorder items in the case of an incoming invoice with reference to a given purchase order.erp.sap.invoice.Transfer: Subworkflow for transferring an invoice document to SAP. Thesystem automatically distinguishes between the variants document parking/direct posting or with/without order reference and sends it to the respective function module mapping. Youselect between document parking and direct posting in the invoice.config, see also chapter invoice.config â€“ General. In this case, you do not have to modify the workflow.erp.sap.invoice.Simulation: Subworkflow for the posting simulation or validation of invoiceswithout an order reference. This workflow is optional and can be integrated if required; it isâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 10 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)not used in the standard software. You have to change the function module mapping that youwant to call in the workflow directly.erp.sap.invoice.Link: Subworkflow for linking the documents generated in ELO with thecorresponding documents in ELO. This adds the ELO document to the attachment list of theSAP document and determines the SAP object that is displayed when accessed from ELOToolbox for SAPÂ® ERP.erp.sap.invoice.ErrorHandling: Subworkflow for error handling. This workflow is called iferrors occurred during transfer to SAP or processing within the SAP system (e.g. errormessages in cases of inconsistent documents).General comments If you make changes to the basic workflow and, especially when reusing workflows, be aware thatcertain fields in the respective SORD are used to control the workflow. These are the followingfields:ERP_STATE (metadata field): Status field for calling the function module mapping. Thefunction module mapping writes the success or error status to this field. The possible statusvalues in the respective version of Template Invoice can be taken from the subworkflows orthe function module mapping.ERP_SAP_INVOICE_TRANSFERRED (map field): Determines whether and how the invoice wastransferred to SAP (e.g. parked/posted). The workflow checks this field to ensure that theinvoice is not transferred to SAP twice.WITH_PO_REFERENCE (map field): Specifies whether an invoice has a purchase orderreference. Based on this field, the business transaction is controlled accordingly in theworkflows (see posting in SAP with transactions MIRO vs. FB60).SAP_INV_DISTRIB (map field): Contains an aggregated view of the account assignmentcategories of all purchase order items (only if the invoice has an order reference). If there isat least one item with multiple account assignments (field is not empty), only the "invoicebody" is transferred, see also Multiple account assignment of purchase order items (MM).Transfer to SAP Invoice data is transferred</s> 
<s>to the SAP system with the help of the Datatransfer function modulemapping. An RFC-capable function module that can generate the transaction data is required foreach business transaction to be posted in SAP. The SAP Business Application ProgrammingInterface (BAPI) consists of a number of RFC-enabled function modules (referred to here as BAPIs)for posting various business transactions. The abbreviations FI (Finance) and MM (MaterialsManagement) used in this documentation refer to the SAP modules of the same name:FI invoice: Invoice in financial accounting (without order reference, SAP transactions FB01, FB60 etc.)MM invoice: Invoice in materials management (with order reference, SAP transaction MIRO)BAPIs Template Invoice uses the following BAPIs:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 11 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_PARK: Parks MM invoice documents, see SAP transaction MIR7BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE: Directly posts MM invoice documents, see SAP transaction MIROBAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_SAVE: Transfers the "body" of MM invoices containing items withmultiple account assignments, see also Multiple account assignment of purchase order items(MM)BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST: Parks or directly posts FI invoice documents, see SAPtransactions FB01 or FBV1BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_CHECK: Validates or simulates FI invoices without generatingtransaction data in SAPBAdIs It can generally be assumed that the functionality and behavior of a BAPI is identical to its SAPcounterpart (i.e. the corresponding SAP transaction). For example, in most cases, BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST returns the same result as transaction FB01 with the sameparameterization. This is not always the case, however. Some special cases, especiallyautomatisms of an SAP transaction, are not easily mapped by the respective BAPI.The SAP enhancement option Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) is used in cases such as these. Among otherthings, BAdIs allow you to enhance BAPIs using defined interfaces at specific times during internalprocessing. The enhancement is done in SAP (ABAP) by implementing a class with a predefinedinterface. You can refer to the relevant SAP BAPI documentation to find out whether or which BAdIsare available for a BAPI.The Template Invoice SAP transport contains an active implementation of BADI_ACC_DOCUMENTas an enhancement of BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST. The enhancement class /ELO/CL_BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT provides a solution for the following cases, which are not supported bythe BAPI or not all versions of the BAPI:Post to assets (with subnumber and transaction type) with automatic determination of theasset reconciliation accountSet an explicit transaction code in the document headerPost accrual/deferral documents with reversal date (see SAP transaction FBS1)Cash discount net procedureInformationDetails of the above transactions and the corresponding parameterization are described inthe respective subchapters of chapter Special business transactions.The BAPI table EXTENSION2 is transferred to the BAdI when called. This table must be correctlyparameterized since the provided BAdI implementation only makes document changes on explicitinstruction for security reasons. To prevent possible collisions with other BAdI implementations, theSTRUCTURE field always contains a data element (existing in the ABAP Dictionary) in thenamespace /ELO/ for all EXTENSION2 lines transferred from ELO. The BAdI ignores all lines withdifferent values in the STRUCTURE field. This ensures that the BAdI can only make documentâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 12 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)changes when called by ELO but</s> 
<s>also minimizes the potential for conflicts with other BAdIimplementations (if any) since it is bound to a reserved namespace. In any case, you need to checkwhether /ELO/CL_BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT is functioning properly in the customer system (especiallyif other active BAdI implementations are in use).The exact key of the data element is stored in the class constant /ELO/CL_BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT=>CO_PRM_ELOSTRUC. We cannot guarantee that this key will not haveto be changed for technical reasons in a future Template Invoice release. However, we do notexpect the namespace to change.The general structure of a line in EXTENSION2 for the provided BAdI implementation is as follows:STRUCTURE: /ELO/EXTENSION2 (fixed value)VALUEPART1: Name of the parameter, e.g. ASSET_MOVEMENT_TYPEVALUEPART2: Number of the reference line according to BAPI, e.g. 3 (without line reference empty)VALUEPART3 and VALUEPART4: Value of the parameter; both fields are concatenated beforeprocessingUse case and process example This chapter describes how to enter an incoming invoice using the standard configuration ofTemplate Invoice. The focus is on the ELO Invoice extensions, which enable users to capture all theinvoice data necessary for successfully transferring the invoice to SAP. Knowledge of the standardfunctionalities and basics of ELO Invoice are required and will not be explained here.The process example described here starts after a new invoice document has been stored. In manycases, ELO DocXtractor is already in use on the customer's system, and has already completedsome or even all the necessary fields of the invoice. This process description does not explain howto configure and use ELO DocXtractor in the context of processing incoming invoices.Automatic download If header data already exists when the invoice document is stored, it is possible to retrieveadditional invoice information from SAP in advance. To do so, you need to execute the subworkflowerp.sap.invoice.Download. This workflow checks whether the invoice has an order reference (mapfield WITH_PO_REFERENCE) and subsequently loads the items of the SAP purchase orders enteredinto the item data (function module mapping getItemData). If the SAP purchase orders are onlyknown at the time of manual entry, the items can also be loaded via the form, see the Enteringinvoice data section.Entering invoice data In the form stored for the workflow item, the user can see all available information on the invoiceas well as check, enter, or change information relevant to posting.

If no document type oronly the standard ELO Invoice document type IN has been entered, this value isautomatically replaced with KR (vendor invoice in IDES systems) in the function modulemapping so it can be transferred to SAP.In case of a credit note, the corresponding option must be enabled. Make sure that thedocument type is compatible with this option. To automatically determine the credit notecode based on the document type, see chapter invoice.config</s> 
<s>â€“ Accounting.Company The Company corresponds to the company code used to post the SAP document. The field islinked to the corresponding SAP search help. You have to make an entry in this field; thevalue is not automatically substituted during transfer to SAP.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 14 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Vendor The Vendor number corresponds to the number of the vendor account in SAP. The field islinked to the corresponding SAP search help. You have to make an entry in this field; thevalue is not automatically substituted during transfer to SAP. When you select a vendor in thedynamic keyword list, the name and address data are taken from the vendor master data inthe form.If using a CpD account, the option One-Time Account (CpD) must be enabled. This ensuresthat the search help for the vendor number only displays CpD accounts.During posting, a payment block is set on the open items in the SAP document. The field islinked to the corresponding SAP search help.Invoice data The Invoice date corresponds to the document date and the baseline date for payment in theSAP document.The Booking date is also the booking date for the SAP document.The Currency is the same as the document currency of the entire SAP document including itsitems. The field is linked to the corresponding SAP search help. If you select a foreigncurrency, the respective exchange rate is updated in the ELO Invoice form field provided. Theconversion date for the SAP exchange rate is the booking date. The SAP table TCURR is usedfor the currency conversion.The Internal invoice number is automatically updated by the function module mapping aftersuccessful posting and is used for internal processing.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 15 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Payment terms The input field for the payment terms is linked to the corresponding SAP search help.If you click the button Load terms of payment, you can insert the respective terms into thetable below. Technically, the payment terms are retrieved in the background on execution ofthe search help mapping PaymentTermsLines.If there are entries in the table, these are transferred to SAP as payment terms for the openitem. These take priority over the customized terms of payment key. Only the first three(highlighted in color) lines in SAP are taken into account. Manually entered or changedpayment terms must comply with SAP requirements (e.g. days in ascending order,percentages in descending order, etc.).If there are no entries in the table, SAP automatically takes the respective payment termsfrom the customized terms of payment key.Purchase orders In the case of MM invoices, the With order reference option must be enabled.You can enter the purchase order numbers in the table below or select them using the SAPsearch help.The Load purchase order items button loads the purchase order items from SAP and insertsthem into the item table (Item data tab). Technically, the purchase order items are retrievedin the background on execution of the search help mapping PurchaseOrderItems.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 16 ELO</s> 
<s>Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Entering item data Once you have entered the invoice or header data, the invoice items are entered in the Item dataform tab. Each invoice item must contain sufficient information for posting in SAP. This usuallyimplies a GL account, a controlling object (e.g. cost center), quantity, unit price, and a tax code. Allfields with a reference to an SAP object are linked to a corresponding search help. Which fields inwhich constellations are actually mandatory in the customer system depends on its customizingrequirements and, if applicable, custom validation and substitution rules. The required posting ratefor each scenario must be approved by the responsible accounting staff and technically validated.When a tax code is selected, the corresponding tax rate is automatically updated for the item.Based on the quantity, unit price, and tax rate, it is possible to automatically calculate the otheramount fields in the item lines (e.g. tax amount, gross amount, etc.).InformationAutomatic calculation or retroactive calculation of amount fields is part of ELO Invoice;details and possible restrictions can be found in the corresponding documentation.In addition, the following technical provisions apply for entering item data:When you select a tax account, the line item is posted as direct tax (for details, see chapter Direct tax (FI)).The Item number field corresponds to the material number in SAP. This field is linked to acorresponding search help.In the case of tax codes with complex tax transactions (e.g. VAT within the EU), the tax linesmust be generated in SAP. For details, see chapter Complex tax transactions (FI). If you selectthese types of tax codes, the Calculate tax in SAP code, which cannot be changed in theform, is automatically updated by SAP for each item.Entering footer data As provided in ELO Invoice, you can enter surcharges in the Footer data form tab. Remember toconsider the requirements of the respective SAP system in terms of account assignment data, asexplained in the Purchase orders section. A new document is created with each surcharge, andwhere applicable, a tax line in the SAP document. Template Invoice does not provide an option forposting discounts in SAP. Depending on the SAP customizing, it would be possible to allow fornegative surcharges, but this solution would have to be validated in the respective system.The non-modifiable field Calculate tax in SAP in the center of the footer data is enabled as soon asthe code of the same name is enabled in at least one invoice, surcharge, or discount item. Thiscode is used as an auxiliary field for internal processing.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 17 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Release and approval Once the document has been entered, validated, and released, a multi-step approval process takesplace in accordance with the basic ELO Invoice workflow. During the individual steps, the respectiveusers are given role-based access to the document data and can make changes if necessary.InformationTemplate Invoice does not extend every (role-based) form module in ELO Invoice. Forexample, there may be fields with a reference to SAP that are linked to a</s> 
<s>correspondingsearch help. Depending on which form modules are going to be used in the customer'sprocess, it is possible that some form modules will need to be changed. The form modulesmodified by Template Invoice are used as a template.Transfer to SAP After all necessary approval steps have been completed, the invoice is transferred to SAP (ERPexport). To do so, you need to execute the workflow erp.sap.invoice.Transfer. For technical basics ofthe transfer process, see chapter Transfer to SAP.18 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)ErrorHandling If errors occurred during transmission, the basic workflow branches off to the ErrorHandling. Withthe corresponding workflow item, the user has access to the form and can fix errors. All errors thatoccurred during transmission are recorded in the SAP form tab. In this context, we have todistinguish between technical errors and business errors:Technical errors are error messages that are returned by the called function module in SAPduring document validation, e.g. posting period is not open. BAPIs with the same cause oferror also output the same error messages in the corresponding SAP transaction (e.g. FB60).Technical errors normally occur during processing in ELO and typically mean the document isnot transferred to SAP. You can usually recognize these kinds of errors by a stack trace at thebeginning of the error message. Common causes of errors:Connection cannot be established (e.g. incorrect/insufficient configuration of the connectionsettings in Datatransfer or a network error)Syntax error in function module mapping, especially with Handlebars expressionsRuntime errors in a script (e.g. preprocessor in function module mapping)Special case: Runtime errors during execution in SAP. This can occur especially with customfunction modules and enhancement implementations.Once the cause of the error has been eliminated, the document can be transferred to SAP again.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 19 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Linking As soon as the document has been successfully transferred to SAP, the link is established via thesubworkflow erp.sap.invoice.Link. Once it is successfully linked, the ELO document can be found inthe attachment list of the SAP document.Tracking the posted document The document number and fiscal year of the document posted in SAP is recorded in the SAP formtab. The document flow within SAP is periodically tracked by the ELOas rule erp.sap.invoice.as.DocumentState and updated in ELO. The individual document number categoriesare:Parked/Logistics Invoice: All documents generated out of ELO (only parked) or all MMdocumentsOpen items: Either FI documents posted directly from ELO (not parked) or the follow-updocument of an MM document or parked FI documentBalanced: The clearing document for the open item (e.g. through payment in the paymentprogram)To use document tracking, the option Open item management in the respective company codecustomizing must be enabled.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 20 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)ELO configuration Template Invoice offers a wide range of configuration options to adapt the functionality toindividual needs. All search help and function module mappings provided as standard are based onDatatransfer and are therefore not explained in detail. This chapter focuses on the configurationoptions of invoice.config. Selected search</s> 
<s>help and function module mappings of particularimportance are also explained in parts.Please noteYou should only make changes to the configuration of Template Invoice in the BusinessSolutions Custom folder to ensure you can update the system in the future. All files in thebase folder may be deleted or overwritten when an update is installed.InformationDuring installation, you may not be able to open the configuration interface of configurationfiles, see chapter Installation information.Invoice.config The configuration interface has several tabs: General, Accounting, Status Query, and Posting Lines(in expert mode).invoice.config â€“ General You always have to make settings in the General tab. This tab primarily contains the settings forSAP ArchiveLink for each type of invoice object in SAP, i.e. MM invoices with order reference and FIinvoices without order reference. The following figure shows the fields which you should check andmodify if necessary:Content repositoryDocument typeâ€¢ â€¢ 21 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)You do not usually need to modify the default values. This is only required in special cases. It isespecially important to note that the workflows provided with Template Invoice have dependencieswith these settings. For example, the Link subworkflow expects the default success and errorvalues in the default status field. If changes are made, the workflow must be checked and modifiedif required.The configuration for invoices without order reference is identical.Under Workflow mapping for purchase order reference or Workflow mapping without purchase orderreference, you define which function module mapping is to be executed for posting FI or MM22 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)invoices. Specifically, the Transfer subworkflow reads the mappings to be executed each time it isexecuted from this configuration. In the standard version, you can choose between parking anddirect posting:invoicePark: Park MM invoiceinvoicePost: Directly post MM invoiceinvoiceParkFI: Park FI invoiceinvoicePostFI: Directly post FI invoiceIn addition, you can enter any (specially created in functionModuleMappings.config) mapping name.You can even interchange the entire configuration file if required.The special case of transferring an invoice body or the mapping provided for it should not beconfigured at this point. For more details, see Multiple account assignment of purchase order items(MM).invoice.config â€“ Accounting The Accounting tab contains settings that influence the behavior of the form and the accountinglogic in SAP.Document types for credit noteThis area contains the options for handling credit note document types in SAP. Here, you canautomatically enable or disable the Credit note code in the form depending on the selecteddocument type.The first step is to identify all SAP document types intended for credit notes and enter them in thelist. In the next step, you define the behavior of the form when you select a document type that isor is not in the list.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 23 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)When you select a document type, the setting Behavior for credit note document types takeseffect:(no reaction): The Credit note code is not changed.Suggested value: The Credit note code is enabled but can be disabled by the user.Force: The Credit note code is enabled and</s> 
<s>cannot be disabled by the user.When you select a document type that is not in the list, the setting Behavior for other documenttypes takes effect:(no reaction): The Credit note code is not changed.Suggested value: The Credit note code is disabled but can be enabled by the user.Force: The Credit note code is disabled and cannot be enabled by the user.Technically, the Force option sets the corresponding check box on the form to read-only. However,this setting is not permanent. If the form is reloaded, the check box can be changed again.Cash discount: Automatic net procedureIf this option is enabled, the cash discount net procedure is automatically applied if the selecteddocument type is a net document type. For details about this type of transaction, see Cash discountnet procedure (FI).invoice.config â€“ Status Query In addition to the status values provided in ELO Invoice, Template Invoice includes the followingstatuses:10: Parked FI invoice or parked or directly posted MM invoice11 (Open items): Directly posted FI document or follow-up FI document of an MM document12: Clearing document for the open itemThe aforementioned values have been added to the corresponding dynamic keyword list for statusvalues in the custom area of sol.invoice. The status values are written in the subworkflow erp.sap.invoice.Link and in the ELOas rule DocumentState.The Status Query tab is where you configure tracking of the invoice document flow in SAP describedin chapter Use case and process example.Generalâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 24 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If you want to track the document status, you need to enable this option under General. You do notusually need to modify the other fields in this area. However, if you use a form for incominginvoices that differs from one of the default forms in ELO Invoice, this form needs to be enteredhere along with the corresponding status field. If the status values are changed, you may need tomake these changes known to ELO Invoice.Mapping status queryThe function module mapping used for tracking parked FI and MM documents or open items in FIcan be changed in the two Mapping status query ... areas if required. The corresponding ELOas rulereads the respective mapping dynamically from this configuration.Check status change25 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The two Check status change... areas is where you specify the conditions under which the statuschange takes place. There are two possible status changes:Parked/Logistics cost accounting (10) âžœ Open items (11)Open items (11) âžœ Balanced (12)For both status changes, you can specify which value a field must contain in order for the statuschange to work. If you enable not empty, the field only needs to exist and contain a value.The mappings used in the basic configuration write the document number of the open item andlater of the adjustment posting to the SORD. Since the document numbers are recorded in differentfields, you only need to check that the field is not empty for the status change to be executed.invoice.config â€“ Posting Lines You only see</s> 
<s>the Posting Lines tab after you have enabled the expert mode. This is where youconfigure the preprocessor for FI postings, known as the posting line script. The posting line scriptis only used for FI invoices, i.e. the script is the preprocessor for the mappings invoiceParkFI and invoicePostFI, which both address the SAP function module BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST. Fordetails about the posting line script, see 'invoicePostFI' mapping.Preprocessing function posting linesThis section contains a description of the individual fields in the Preprocessing function postinglines area. All referenced tables or structures and their fields refer to the interface of the SAPfunction module (BAPI) mentioned above.Currency type: SAP currency type for all amounts, default: 00 (document currency); is set inthe BAPI as a fixed value in each currency line (CURRENCYAMOUNT-CURR_TYPE).Thousands separator: Thousands separator used to interpret amount fieldsDecimal separator: Decimal separator used to interpret amount fieldsItem indicator: Indicator field * (map field) for item linesSurcharge indicator: Indicator field * (map field) for item linesTax indicator: Indicator field * (map field) for item lines * Indicator fields control the loop overthe lines a table. As soon as the indicator field in a table row is empty, the loop stops and theâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 26 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)table is no longer processed. For each table, you should therefore select one field which isfilled in each line to be processed.Tax calculation mappingAs described in Use case and process example, a separate tax calculation sometimes needs to bedone in SAP (for technical details, see Complex tax transactions (FI)). If the corresponding code isset in the footer of the document, the posting line script executes the tax calculation mappingdefined in the configuration before it is transferred to the BAPI and accepts the returned tax lines.You can change the respective mapping and/or the corresponding configuration file at this point.Field mappingsThe Field mappings area acts as an abstraction layer to ensure that you do not need to hard codefields or field values in the posting line script. The field list on the left side contains the internalidentifiers for each field as they are expected and read by the posting line script. Once you haveselected an identifier, the map, metadata, or SORD field is mapped on the right side.This way, the mapped fields of the basic configuration are easily interchangeable. It is also possibleto add new field mappings with new identifiers. However, this only makes sense if associated witha modification of the posting line script. Although the new identifier and the corresponding fieldvalue are made available to the basic script, it will not be accessed since the identifier is notknown to it.27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Search help mapping You are required to have basic knowledge of the search help mapping and its configuration as wellas how to use search helps as dynamic keyword lists.Search helps in Template Invoice serve the following purposes:To help the user complete form fields by displaying a filtered value list with additionalinformation</s> 
<s>about the object (identical to search helps in SAP GUI)To transfer additional information about the selected list object (e.g. vendor address)In many cases, the function module mapping is not required to retrieve data from SAP in the formcontext. Instead, all fields in an SAP search help output can be written to a suitable field in theform. This is beneficial for performance since the actual list values and the associated metadataonly need to be transferred to ELO. In addition, you have access to data sources within all theelementary search helps available in the SAP system and not just RFC function modules.All search help mappings provided can be viewed in the configuration file searchHelps.config underthe administration path illustrated above. The following section only contains a few special searchhelps and general remarks.'TaxCodes' mapping The SAP search help /ELO/SH_TAX_CODES provides tax codes (if necessary, also broken down intolevels according to tax jurisdiction codes) and additional information necessary for the generationof the tax lines.Complex/multi-level tax codes (e.g. for the reverse charge system within the EU) are alwaysassigned a tax rate of 0.00% and a corresponding code (for details see Complex tax transactions(FI)).When selecting a tax code, the following additional information is transferred (for specific fieldnames, see Configuration):Tax rate (or 0.00 %, see above)Tax accountTax transaction keyâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 28 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Tax condition typeCode for complex tax transactions, see above'CurrencyRates' mapping If invoices are issued in a foreign currency, it is usually preferable to have the amounts displayedand updated in local currency in an ELO program, e.g. for simple plausibility checks of the amountsor for use in subsequent processes within ELO (e.g. ELO Invoice dashboard). Since the SAP systemrequires the respective valid exchange rates for posting in foreign currencies anyway, TemplateInvoice replaces the exchange rate determination of ELO Invoice with a corresponding search help.The SAP search help /ELO/SH_CURRENCY determines the exchange rate between a local currencyand all foreign currencies in the respective hit list. The exchange rate of the selected foreigncurrency is updated in the ELO Invoice form field provided.The following search help parameters are especially important:HOME_CUR: Local currency (usually configured in ELO Invoice)WAERS: Key of (foreign) currencyFXDATE: Exchange rate date for currency conversionFXTYPE: Exchange rate type for currency conversionINVERSE_RATE: Indicator for reversing the SAP exchange rates. If enabled, the inverse valueis determined for all foreign currency rates determined in SAP before output. This should beenabled for compatibility with ELO Invoice.You can also store an ISO code in SAP for each currency key. It does not have to be identical. ISOcodes are ignored in the basic configuration, which means that only the SAP currency key is usedfor the form entry and posting in SAP. Besides the currency field in ELO Invoice(INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE), an additional map field (IX_MAP_ERP_SAP_CURRENCY) is provided forextension purposes. This additional field provides an option to distinguish between the currencykey that ELO Invoice processes and the currency key used for posting in SAP.Since a search help field can only be written back once due</s> 
<s>to technical restrictions (but notmultiple times into different SORD fields), the search help contains the two fields WAERS_COPY andISOCD_COPY, which contain the same value as the fields WAERS and ISOCD, respectively. Thisensures the greatest possible flexibility during configuration.If you want to change the behavior, you must make the following settings according to thescenario:Scenario 1: Update ISO codes/post with SAP currency keys In this scenario, we want the ISO codes in the standard field for the document currency (INVOICE_CURRENCY_CODE) to be updated, e.g. to align deviating currency keys from differentsources. However, we want to use the SAP currency key for posting.Required settings:1 Search help output CurrencyRatesâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 29 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The ISO code is written to the standard field; the SAP currency key is written to the additional field.2 Field mappings posting line script (without order reference)In the field mappings for the posting line script (invoice.config/expert mode), the additional fieldhas to be assigned to the script field currencyCode.3 Function module mappingYou need to check whether the additional field is transferred as a currency key for all posting-relevant function module mappings. In the case of invoices without an order reference, each lineitem is accessed using Handlebars syntax:In the case of invoices with an order reference, the map field ERP_SAP_CURRENCY is assigneddirectly.Fields for ISO codes should not be transferred in this scenario, e.g. you need to remove the checkmark next to Transfer for the field CURRENCYAMOUNT-CURRENCY_ISO for all relevant mappings forBAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST.Scenario 2: Update and post with ISO codes In this scenario, we want to update the document currency in the context of ELO Invoice and postthe invoice in SAP based on ISO codes.Required settings:{{{preObj.currencyamount.{I}.currency}}}30 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)1 Search help output CurrencyRatesThe ISO code is written to the standard field and the additional field.2 Function module mappingYou must disable the option to transfer SAP currency keys in all relevant mappings, e.g. the field CURRENCYAMOUNT-CURRENCY in all relevant mappings for BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST. Instead,only corresponding ISO code fields should be transferred, e.g. CURRENCYAMOUNT-CURRENCY_ISO.For more information about parameterization, see scenario 1.You should generally check the specific requirements in the customer system regarding the transferof ISO codes. There is no guarantee that every SAP system supports the transmission of ISOcurrency codes alone.The settings described above should only be made if the SAP currency key and the ISO codesassigned to it are different. Aligning them in SAP is another solution and would eliminate the needfor additional settings in ELO.InformationIn all cases, it is recommended that you always and exclusively transfer the SAP currencykey for postings in SAP. A significant issue related to exclusively using ISO codes is the factthat the same ISO code can technically be assigned to multiple SAP currencies. It is alsopossible that no ISO code is assigned to an SAP currency.'PurchaseOrderItems' mapping The PurchaseOrderItems mapping is used to subsequently load purchase order items into theinvoice form. This mapping is called in the background by a form script, which then</s> 
<s>assigns theresults list to the item lines. Besides the relevant master data fields, it is possible to influence theoutput of the linked SAP search help /ELO/SH_PO_ITEMS using specific input parameters:EXCL_STAPO (flag): If enabled, the results list does not contain any statistical orderreferences (see table EKPO, field STAPO).CALC_QTY (flag): If enabled, only the open delivery quantities per item are returned. Opendelivery quantities are quantities already received but for which an invoice has not yet beenposted. If disabled, the total quantity of the purchase order is returned.EXCL_USED (flag): If enabled, purchase order items that have already been fully invoiced areexcluded from the selection. "Fully invoiced" means that incoming invoice(s) have beenâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 31 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)posted for the total quantity of goods received. Consequently, it only makes sense to use itin conjunction with enabled CALC_QTY.The search help also returns the field DISTRIB, which contains the account assignmentcategory of the purchase order item, see Multiple account assignment of purchase orderitems (MM).The mapping for individual selection of purchase order items via the dynamic keyword list in theitem table also accesses the SAP search help /ELO/SH_PO_ITEMS. The explanations in thissubchapter apply equally in this case.Mappings for partner bank types Partner bank types are linked to various SAP search helps per account type via the mappings PartnerBankVendor (vendors) and PartnerBankCustomer (customers).Depending on the SAP system (especially S/4 systems), you may have to remove the filter on thesearch help field TABNAME in each mapping.Mappings for customer and vendor accounts The mappings Vendor and Customer are provided for vendor and customer numbers. The SAPsearch helps provided specifically for this purpose offer an extended field selection compared tothe respective standard search helps.In the standard software version, accounts are filtered according to the CpD indicator (Invoice dataform):If the CpD indicator is set, only CpD accounts are displayed.If the CpD indicator is not set, only accounts are displayed that are not CpD accounts.Integrated SAP search helps As you have already learned in earlier subchapters, the SAP transport for Template Invoice includessome SAP search helps in the namespace /ELO/. These allow you to extend the functionality ofstandard search helps. In terms of configuration and use, these search helps behave in the sameway as elementary search helps in standard SAP. You will find all integrated search helps either inSAP directly or in searchHelps.config under the respective mapping. These are recognizable in bothcases by the aforementioned namespace prefix of the SAP search help.Localized date formats When you call search help mappings (unlike function module mappings), date values aretransferred from the form in a localized format based on the user (e.g. 07/25/2020 [US] vs. 25.07.2020 [EN]). To ensure that the search help call is executed in a date format that SAP canunderstand, the header script extension of Template Invoice writes the respective date format tothe hidden map field LCL_DATE_FORMAT. This field is used by all search help mappings for dateinterpretation and can also be used for custom mappings.â€¢ â€¢ 32 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ®</s> 
<s>& SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Example: To filter cost centers by validity periods, the CostCenter mapping transfers a from and todate as filter criteria. A Handlebars expression converts the local booking date into a date that iscompatible with SAP.Surcharge search helps The surcharge table in the Invoice form contains fields that have the same description as in theitem table but technically have different variable names. This means that all fields in the surchargetable must use their own search mapping. In terms of content, these search helps usually do notdiffer from their counterparts in the item table. For example, the Cost center field calls the sameSAP search help with the same filter criteria in both cases. Only the focus fields, and possibly otherfields to which data is written back or which are used as filters, differ in the mappings. Accordingly,when you modify a search help mapping, you also need to consider the respective counterpart inthe item or surcharge table. The search help mappings for the surcharge table have the suffix ForCharges, e.g. TaxCodesForCharges.Search helps in different form modules ELO Invoice contains a variety of form modules, such as different role-based views of the invoicedocument.Not all form modules that contain fields with a reference to SAP are linked to search helps inTemplate Invoice (e.g. module 611_position_data_compact). If required, SAP search helps can belinked to customer search helps in the implementation project. In most cases, you can use thefields of the item table (module 619_position_data_ext_sap) as a template.Function module mapping This section requires you to have basic knowledge of the function module mapping and itsconfiguration as well as the functionality of SAP function modules.Function module mappings in Template Invoice serve the following purposes:{{{formatDate "YYYYMMDD" IX_GRP_ERP_BOOKING_DATE IX_MAP_LCL_DATE_FORMAT}}}â€¢ 33 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)To read additional data from SAP relevant for processing incoming invoices (e.g. order items),especially during background processing (e.g. in the workflow) and generally for complexdata structures.To generate or simulate transaction data in SAP. Specifically, Template Invoice primarily usesfunction modules to post or park different types of incoming invoices in SAP.The following subchapters list all the function module mappings provided in the standard softwarepackage. Unique aspects are explained in detail for each mapping.'docOpenItemsCheck' mapping This mapping is for document tracking and is used by the ELOas rule DocumentState. It addressesthe SAP function module /ELO/GET_INVOICE_STATE.The function module receives the document number of a parked FI document or an MM documentand returns, if available, the number and year of the corresponding follow-up FI document used tocreate an open item on the respective vendor or customer.'docBalancedCheck' mapping The docBalancedCheck mapping works in the same way as docOpenItemsCheck, except that itsearches the clearing document for the open item. If it is found, the document number and year arewritten back separately. For details, see 'docOpenItemsCheck' mapping.'getItemData' mapping This mapping downloads purchase order items from SAP. In the standard version, this mapping iscalled in the subworkflow erp.sap.invoice.Download after automatic analysis, usually by ELODocXtractor. This calls the SAP function module BAPI_PO_GETITEMS.If there is more than one purchase order</s> 
<s>for the incoming invoice, we end up with a uniqueparameterization: The BAPI does not offer multiple selection via the purchase order number. Toprevent the mapping being called repeatedly, all purchase orders for the entered vendor are loadedinstead. The relevant purchase order items are then filtered out with the help of the advanced datatransfer function.Since the order unit is also required, the field is mapped under Mappings. You can also map otherfields from this table here if required.Please noteReturn tables that are filtered using the advanced data transfer function should normally nothave field mappings for the respective interface parameter, since the filter criteria are notâ€¢ 34 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)applied here. Instead, all relevant interface table fields should be linked to the target field inELO in the Mappings area.'invoicePost' mapping MM invoices are posted directly with the mapping invoicePost, which calls the function module BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE. Since this BAPI has a similar function to the SAP transaction MIRO, it can be used for a variety of business processes in the context of processing MM invoices.Accordingly, there is a wide range of parameterization options that must always be evaluated onan individual customer basis. For details on the functionality and parameterization of BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE, refer to the corresponding SAP documentation or SAP Notes.The basic structure of the relevant BAPI interface parameters in the standard software package isas follows:IMPORTINGHEADERDATA: Document header data, e.g. booking date, gross amount, invoicing partyADDRESSDATA: Address of the invoicing party and identification of one-time accounts (CpD)TABLESITEMDATA: Item data without account assignment, e.g. quantities (units), amountsACCOUNTINGDATA: Account assignment data per item, complementary to ITEMDATAGLACCOUNTDATA: Item data without reference to a purchase order item, used in TemplateInvoice for surchargesSuccess or error messages can be retrieved using the BAPI table RETURN. After successful posting,the document number (INVOICEDOCNUMBER) and the fiscal year (FISCALYEAR) of the createdposting are returned.'invoicePark' mapping This mapping is used to park an MM invoice and calls BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_PARK. Theparameterization is identical to BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE, see invoicePost mapping.You can then later post the parked document manually in SAP or automatically via BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_POST. This process is not part of Template Invoice.'invoiceSave' mapping This mapping is used to park an MM invoice and calls BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_SAVE. It generatesthe body of an MM invoice, i.e. when this mapping is called, an invoice without item data is parked.This is especially useful or necessary in more complex scenarios if the item lines cannot be(easily) determined in ELO and an SAP standard transaction (e.g. MIRO) needs to be used instead.This is the case, for example, with order items with multiple account assignments, i.e. purchaseorder items that allocate the bookable quantities to different account assignment objects accordingto specific rules. When the purchase order items are loaded with the function module mapping â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 35 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)getItemData or the search help mapping PurchaseOrderItems, the distribution type (SAP field DISTRIB) is written back for each item. If this is the case, the invoice posting in the standardworkflow is</s> 
<s>rejected with this mapping (invoiceSave). To ensure backwards compatibility, you needto enable this behavior once, see Multiple account assignment of purchase order items (MM).When transferring the invoice body, it is irrelevant whether the invoice has other items with singleaccount assignment. As soon as the invoice has an item with multiple account assignment, no itemdata is transferred, not even of items with single account assignment. However, the actualpurchase orders and associated items are transferred as suggestions. When you open thegenerated document in SAP (e.g. via MIRO), it is therefore possible to determine the suggestedpurchase order items automatically. The rules for multiple account assignment per item are alsoapplied. The invoice can now be posted in SAP.If, however, a customer project requires complex derivations (such as the case described above) tobe made directly in ELO, this requirement must be evaluated and implemented in the customerproject. Template Invoice does not include the application of SAP distribution rules for purchaseorder items with multiple account assignments in ELO.'invoicePostFI' mapping FI invoices are posted directly with the mapping invoicePostFI, which calls the function module BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST. Since this BAPI has a similar function to the SAP transaction FB01, itcan be used for a variety of business processes in the context of processing FI invoices.Accordingly, there is a wide range of parameterization options that must always be evaluated onan individual customer basis. For details on the functionality and parameterization of BAPI_INCOMINGINVOICE_CREATE, refer to the corresponding SAP documentation or SAP Notes.The basic structure of the relevant BAPI interface parameters in the standard software package isas follows:IMPORTINGDOCUMENTHEADER: Document header data, e.g. booking date, vendor, company codeCUSTOMERCPD: Additional data (especially address) for the one-time account (CpD)TABLESACCOUNTGL: Item data for GL account linesACCOUNTRECEIVABLE: Item data for customer linesACCOUNTPAYABLE: Item data for vendor linesACCOUNTTAX: Tax linesCURRENCYAMOUNT: Amounts and currencies for the above item linesEXTENSION2: Additional data for BADI_ACC_DOCUMENT, see also chapter BAdIsThis mapping uses the posting line script as a preprocessor script(RF_erp_sap_invoice_service_GetPostingLines, available in expert mode under Preprocessing IXfunction). The purpose of the posting line script is to separate the form information, usually onlyavailable in header and item data, into the different table structures of the BAPI (see above). Inaddition, the posting row script makes some case distinctions, such as setting suitable parametersâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 36 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)for BAdI processing (EXTENSION2). Use of Handlebars expressions alone in MAPLOOPs is notworkable here.With table-type structures, the output object of the posting row script is accessed in the mappingprocess using Handlebars in OBJ_PROP_LOOP.ExampleGL account lines prepared by the posting row script are stored as objects below preObj.accountgl, each with a consecutive line key.The BAPI table ACCOUNTGL is populated by OBJ_PROP_LOOP via preObj.accountgl. For eachchild object (line), the individual fields are accessed via Handlebars, with {I} acting as aplaceholder for the current line in the loop.accesses the GL account of the current line, for example.This example also illustrates that the actual JSON key (property) of each child object (line)has no further relevance when mapping in</s> 
<s>the OBJ_PROP_LOOP, since it is represented bythe placeholder. Moreover, the key is a technical necessity for the preprocessor script.The EXTENSION2 table is used to transfer control and user data to the provided BAdI. If you don'twant this (e.g. due to conflicts with other BAdI implementations which cannot be resolved usingsuitable filter criteria), you must disable the transfer of the table entirely. Doing so means that thefunctionality described in chapter BAdIs is no longer available.'invoiceParkFI' mapping This mapping is used to park an FI invoice and is largely identical to the mapping for direct posting,see invoicePost mapping. It addresses the same function module with almost identicalparameterization. The main difference occurs in the field DOCUMENTHEADER - BUS_ACT (businesstransaction), which controls parking (instead of direct posting).You can then later post the parked document manually in SAP. A BAPI for posting parked FIdocuments is not provided, see SAP Note 2092366. If necessary, you should check otherautomation options (e.g. batch input, [custom] function module) or the initial direct posting fromELO in the customer project.The EXTENSION2 table is used to transfer control and user data to the provided BAdI. If you don'twant this (e.g. due to conflicts with other BAdI implementations which cannot be resolved usingsuitable filter criteria), you must disable the transfer of the table entirely.

If necessary, implement this note and the dependent notes.'invoiceCheckFI' mapping This mapping is used to simulate an FI invoice and is largely identical to the mapping for directposting, see invoicePost mapping. The function module called here is BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_CHECK and is used to validate the respective parameters of an FI posting.The function module does not generate an FI document but only simulates a posting. Error orsuccess messages are found in the table RETURN, as with BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST.The invoiceCheckFI mapping is not used in the standard version and can be integrated at anappropriate point if required, such as in a custom workflow. A subworkflow for the postingsimulation is also provided: erp.sap.invoice.Simulation.Please noteIn most cases, the invoiceCheckFI call is followed by a call from a posting mapping (e.g. invoiceParkFI). Therefore, when you change a posting mapping, you need to check whetherthe respective change must also be made for invoiceCheckFI, and vice versa. Otherwise, thecheck result could differ from the posting result because the parameterization is different.The EXTENSION2 table is used to transfer control and user data to the provided BAdI. If you don'twant this (e.g. due to conflicts with other BAdI implementations which cannot be resolved usingsuitable filter criteria), you must disable the transfer of the table entirely. Doing so means that thefunctionality described in chapter BAdIs is no longer available.'invoiceTaxCalculate' mapping The invoiceTaxCalculate mapping is used in SAP to calculate tax on FI documents. The BAPIs forposting/parking FI invoices do not offer automatic calculation of tax document item lines butinstead expect them in complete form (see</s> 
<s>parameter table ACCOUNTTAX).In simple cases (e.g. VAT on national transactions), the tax item lines can be generated directly inELO. Necessary additional data, such as the tax account or the transaction key, is provided by thesearch help mapping TaxCodes.With complex tax transactions, such as those within the EU, you need to calculate the tax in SAP.For this purpose, SAP provides the FI_TAX_SERVICES_CALCULATE function module as an addition tothe BAPIs for FI postings. The interface parameters are the same as for BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST (e.g. invoicePostFI mapping). All CHANGING parameters can bechanged by the function module. In particular, the generated tax lines are returned in the table ACCOUNTTAX and their amounts in the table CURRENCYAMOUNT. If an error occurs, the functionmodule does not make any changes to the document but simply returns corresponding messagesin the RETURN table along with an error code (RETURN_CODE).38 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)InformationThe SAP-side requirements for using invoiceTaxCalculate are described in SAP Note 2712238and its dependencies. If necessary, implement this note and the dependent notes.Technical background:When selected in the form, the search help mapping TaxCodes automatically identifies complex ormulti-level tax codes according to a flag in the search help output. As soon as a tax code in thedocument has this flag, all tax lines (including those for simple tax transactions) must becalculated in SAP. In this case, the posting line script (which is executed when invoicePostFI iscalled) also executes the mapping invoiceTaxCalculate. The tax lines returned by SAP aretransferred to the posting line script output and then transferred to the respective BAPI along withthe remaining document data. If errors occur when calling FI_TAX_SERVICES_CALCULATE, these areforwarded to the calling mapping and updated accordingly on the SORD. The document is nottransferred to SAP.InformationError handling when calling invoiceTaxCalculate within the posting line script has beencarried out since version 1.00.010 of Template Invoice. In older versions, the programattempts to post or park the document and all errors are discarded.The EXTENSION2 table is used to transfer control and user data to the provided BAdI. If you don'twant this (e.g. due to conflicts with other BAdI implementations which cannot be resolved usingsuitable filter criteria), you must disable the transfer of the table entirely. Doing so means that thefunctionality described in chapter BAdIs is no longer available.Status fields for transfer The respective SORD has the following additional map fields for controlling the workflow:ERP_SAP_INVOICE_TRANSFERRED: Is true (field value 1) if transfer to SAP was successfulERP_SAP_INVOICE_TRANSFERRED_TYPE: Specifies whether the document was parked(PARKED) or posted directly (POSTED)The purpose of the fields is, among other things, to prevent the same document from beingtransmitted/posted multiple times.â€¢ â€¢ 39 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)In principle, these fields are solely managed, written, and read by the workflows provided. As anadditional security feature, all posting or parking function module mappings also write directly tothese fields.In the event of a malfunction in the workflow controller (e.g. due to server hardware overload), thisreduces the probability of unintentional multiple transfers.ELO DocXtractor customizations Navigate to Invoice management in</s> 
<s>the ELO Administration Console.You will see the Connector DX mappings tile.Since Template Invoice adds the Credit note check box to the form and the Invoice correction checkbox exists as the equivalent in DocXtractor Verifier, matching between DocXtractor and ELO mustbe done via the connector_dx package. The following extension transfers the check mark from theVerifier to the ELO form.In addition, DocXtractor recognizes whether the invoice has a purchase order reference or not. IfDocXtractor finds a purchase order, this information can be transferred from the Verifier to ELO.Complete the entries in the Mappings tab.40 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)with po reference WITHPOREFERENCE string(/DXDOC/FIELD[@Name='INVISMM']/@Value)is credit note SAPISCREDIT_NOTE string(/DXDOC/FIELD[@Name='INVCREDITNOTE']/@Value)Based on the transferred information, the SAP data associated with the purchase order issubsequently read and transferred to MAP fields.

This business transaction differs from postingto a GL account with the additional specification of an asset; there is no assignment to a GLaccount. To process this type of posting, you need to import and enable the corresponding BAdI(see chapter BAdIs). This is because the parameter for the asset transaction type in the BAPI ismissing, which means that an asset reconciliation account is not derived. The BAdI sets thetransaction type and derives the reconciliation account. It gets the transaction type from theenhancement structure EXTENSION2, which is entered in the posting row script.Template Invoice contains several components that enable you to easily activate asset posting.Generally, all you need to do is show the additional fields.Show additional fields In the sol_invoice form, the following columns of the item table must be displayed under module 619_position_data_ext_sap:erp.sap.invoice.form.assetTop: Asset numbererp.sap.invoice.form.assetSub: Asset subnumbererp.sap.invoice.form.assetMvmtType: Asset movement typeAsset depreciation area Part of the derivation of the asset reconciliation account described in the following subchapter isthe restriction of a posting to the relevant depreciation area. The default value is depreciation area 01. If a customer system uses a different depreciation area, it has to be transferred to the BAdI asan additional parameter via EXTENSION2. We recommend that you customize the posting linescript for this purpose. In the script, you can address the function setDeprArea.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 42 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Use and functionality When assigning to assets, the three additional fields in the respective item line must be completed.All fields are already linked to the corresponding SAP search helps in the standard version.If the asset transaction type has been entered in item lines in the form, the posting line scriptinterprets these as an asset posting. The transaction type is set with reference to the original itemas a table line of EXTENSION2. You can see the exact parameterization in the setAssetMvmtTypefunction of the posting line script. During BAdI processing, the following steps</s> 
<s>are carried out foreach line item with an asset transaction type:If no GL account is set, the asset reconciliation account is derived:Derivation of the account determination based on company code, asset, and subnumber(table ANLA)Derivation of the chart of accounts based on the company code (table T001)Derivation of the reconciliation account based on the chart of accounts, accountdetermination, and depreciation area (table T095)InformationIf a GL account was entered in the form, you post directly to this GL account.The transaction type set by the extension table is used.Asset numbers and subnumbers are part of the BAPI table ACCOUNTGL and are also assignedthere. Therefore, these fields do not need to be transferred via EXTENSION2.Complex tax transactions (FI) Unlike simple tax transactions, there are some tax codes that require you to determine multipletax rates in document item lines. For example, invoices within the EU are usually posted with thesame amount of output and input tax with a zero balance. In this example, one tax code thereforerequires two tax item lines.Template Invoice automatically recognizes multi-level tax transactions and allows SAP to calculatethem before posting. You can recognize these tax codes by the indicator Calculate tax in SAP in thedynamic keyword list for tax codes and after selection by the field with the same name in therespective item line. As soon as the item lines contain at least one such tax code, the field with thesame name is also enabled in the footer data.In these cases, the tax percentage rate in the forms is always 0.00%, since the effective tax ratecannot be calculated in ELO. However, the effective tax rate is often 0.00% anyway (as in theexample above) since the taxes are entered as a zero balance.Technical details and relationships are described in chapter 'invoiceTaxCalculate' mapping.Informationâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 43 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If you always want the tax to be calculated in SAP (even with simple tax transactions), thecorresponding field in the footer data must always be enabled. It is not enabled by default inTemplate Invoice and is not recommended as it would cause all tax information in ELO to belost.Assignment of goods receipt (MM) There may be cases where you want or need to assign multiple goods receipt documents to an MMinvoice item. The recommended solution is to use ELO DocXtractor for (automatic) assignmentbased on advanced purchase order history data.For simple cases involving direct mapping of the invoice item and goods receipt document, theitem table in the form provides hidden fields for material document, document item, and fiscalyear.In the sol_invoice form, the following columns must be displayed under module 619_position_data_ext_sap:erp.sap.invoice.form.matDocNo: Material document number (goods receipt)erp.sap.invoice.form.matDocItem: Item number in the material documenterp.sap.invoice.form.matDocYear: Fiscal year of the material documentThe field for the material document number is linked to a search help and automatically completesthe other two fields according to the selected material document item. Mapping is done in the ITEMDATA table of the invoicePost and invoicePark function module mappings.Multiple account assignment of purchase order items (MM) Background Template Invoice</s> 
<s>does not provide a function for automatically allocating quantities in the case ofpurchase order items with multiple account assignments. The posting process is instead controlledby a workflow using the invoiceSave function module mapping. For more details, see chapter 'invoiceSave' mapping.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 44 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Functionality The transfer produces a parked invoice body without invoice items, but with a selection of thepurchase order items assigned in the form. After you open the parked invoice in SAP (e.g. viatransaction code MIRO), you can load the purchase order items and quantities and allocate themautomatically according to the account assignment rules for each item. Afterwards, you can postthe invoice in SAP.Accordingly, you do not need to enter item data in the form. If you do enter information (e.g.invoiced quantities per item), it is lost during transfer and has to be entered again in SAP.Activation The invoice body is ready for transfer in Template Invoice but is not yet enabled. All you need to dois to modify the workflow erp.sap.invoice.Transfer:Remove the connection:âžœ Add the connection:âžœ Afterwards, the relevant part of the workflow should look like this:Direct tax (FI) This business transaction applies to invoices that include further allocation of taxes incurred. Thismay be the case, for example, if insurance companies charge the insured party for the tax portionof a repair service rendered by a third party. From an accounting point of view, this type of invoiceline item is a direct tax entry, i.e. a direct posting to a tax account without reference to an itemwith a tax base amount (this is only included on the original third-party invoice).45 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Tax accounts can usually be posted directly in SAP, provided that a base amount corresponding tothe respective tax rate is specified. Posting with BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST works in the sameway except that with this method, the direct tax lines must be explicitly marked. Unlike standardGL account lines, direct tax lines must therefore be stored in the BAPI table ACCOUNTTAX andassigned the code DIRECT_TAX and a tax base amount.The tax category of the selected GL account is written to a hidden map field per item line using thesearch help mapping AccountGl. If the tax category corresponds to the < or > (lower or higherthan) characters, the posting line script recognizes the account as a tax account and the line item isrecognized as a direct tax line. In the unlikely event that the customer system requires a differentset of tax categories to identify a tax account, the posting line script needs to be modifiedaccordingly.The tax base amount is automatically determined based on the percentage of the tax code and therespective item line is redirected to the BAPI table ACCOUNTTAX.If you do not want this to happen automatically, you need to prevent the tax category being writtenback to the field IX_MAP_INVI_GLA_TAX_CAT in the aforementioned search help mapping or youneed to redirect the item to another field.Alternatively, you can index direct tax items per line with</s> 
<s>the map field INVI_SAP_DIRECT_TAX. Thecorresponding column of the item table can be displayed for the purpose of manual entry (form sol_invoice, module 619_position_data_ext_sap, column erp.sap.invoice.form.directTax). If INVI_SAP_DIRECT_TAX in an item line is true, the posting line script also treats this line like a directtax line (see above). You can also use a tax category and INVI_SAP_DIRECT_TAX at the same time.Only one of the conditions has to be met to trigger a direct tax posting.Cash discount net procedure (FI) If you specify net document types, the net procedure is not automatically applied with the BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST call. The provided BAdI enables you to apply the net procedureautomatically. Go to the Accounting tab of invoice.config and enable the option Cash discount:Automatic net procedure (see chapter invoice.config â€“ Accounting). Once you have done this, theBAdI is given a corresponding flag via the EXTENSION2 table (for technical details, see the enableAutomaticNetProcedure function in the posting line script).If the BAdI finds a net document type and the automatic net procedure is enabled, the document isposted using the net procedure. The functionality of the SAP transaction FB01 for net documenttypes serves as a model. We cannot guarantee that the FB01 logic is fully congruent with everycustomer system at this point. The posting result using the net procedure needs to be validated inevery case in the respective SAP system. You may be required to change the BAdI logic, e.g. bycopying the BAdI provided.Network posting The item table contains fields that allow you to do postings to network and network activity.In the sol_invoice form, the following columns must be displayed under module 619_position_data_ext_sap:46 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Column heading Map field Meaningerp.sap.invoice.form.networkTop SAP_INVI_NETWORK_TOP Network planerp.sap.invoice.form.networkSub SAP_INVI_NETWORK_SUB Network plan transactionThere is already a search help linked to a dynamic keyword list. The fields are already assigned inthe relevant function module mappings provided in the standard package.FBS1: Accrual/deferral posting with reversal date (FI) This business transaction applies to the accrual/deferral posting of an FI invoice, specifying areversal date and a reversal reason, see SAP transaction FBS1. The purpose of this type of postingis to automatically reverse the document in SAP on a key date (often at the end of a month oryear).BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST does not provide a function for setting the reversal date and thereversal reason. The BAdI provided offers the option to transfer both fields using the BAPI table EXTENSION2. If a document has the reversal date 31.12.2020 and 04 as the reversal reason, thisresults in the following parameterization of EXTENSION2:STRUCTURE VALUEPART1 VALUEPART2 VALUEPART3 VALUEPART4(Line 1) /ELO/EXT_ACC_DOC REV_REASON 04(Line 2) /ELO/EXT_ACC_DOC REV_DATE 20201231The posting line script has two functions for this purpose: setRevReason (reversal reason) and setRevDate (reversal date). These functions are not called by default in Template Invoice and mustbe implemented in the customer project if required.Posting to accounts receivable (FI) In the standard version of Template Invoice, you can specify a vendor but not a customer. TemplateInvoices provides components for posting incoming invoices to customer accounts as debit orcredit items. It is not possible</s> 
<s>to post a conventional customer invoice, i.e. an A/R invoice to acustomer account.Form customization In the sol_invoice form under the optional module 239_vendor_sap_with_customer, you will find theadditional field Customer. To switch the form modules, go to the tab group 004_accounting in theform designer. Remove the assignment to 238_vendor_sap and insert 239_vendor_sap_with_customer in its place.Use and functionality The customer field is now displayed in the form under the vendor number and is linked to a searchhelp that works in the same way as the search help for vendors. This also restricts the results, e.g.to one-time accounts (CpD) provided that the corresponding indicator is set. If there is an entry inthe customer field, the vendor field should be empty (and vice versa). If both fields contain entries,47 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)the vendor entry takes precedence and the customer entry is ignored. This process takes place inthe posting line script. In the relevant function module mappings, the field mapping for customerlines is provided for in the ACCOUNTRECEIVABLE table.Partner bank type The field Partner bank type in the invoice data (module 239_vendor_sap_with_customer) refers tothe search help for vendor partner bank types. If you also want to be able to select customerpartner bank types, you need to create an additional field Partner bank customer based on theoriginal field. The search help mapping PartnerBankCustomer can be linked to the new field.Noted items Noted item postings have purely informative value. They are not displayed in your accounts butare only to remind you of outstanding payments due or to be made.The posting does not update the account balance, and is merely managed as a line item in theopen item account and the special G/L account.You can view the noted items for the respective vendor with the transaction FBL1N if it is a credit-side posting.If you have enabled the Noted item function, a noted item is created in the SAP system when theELO workflow is started. This noted item remains in the SAP system until the ELO workflow hascompleted and the invoice posting has been closed. The noted item is subsequently cancelled.To use the noted item function, you must have enabled the Create noted item option in invoice.config under Accounts payable in the Accounting tab.Please noteThis function requires customizing for noted items within the SAP system.The values listed here are only a guide and must be modified according to your customizingsettings.Field Value MeaningBusiness transaction RFST FI statistical postingsDocument status S Noted item K + P special G/LID Z Statistical vendor invoicePosting key 39 Vendor credit posting48 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)InformationNoted item attachments are linked to the BKPF SAP object within the SAP system.

In some SAP systems, thistable may be empty or not up to date. In this case, SAP usually updates the payment locks in table T008 instead. The search help then either returns no or unwanted values.There are various solutions you can use:Change the search help mapping specified above to an SAP search help with access to table T008 (e.g. H_FARP_T008)Migrate payment blocks from (tables) T008, T008T to TFK008, TFK008T using SAP report FKKXPR04.Please noteThis report performs the migration for all SAP mandates. Use this report at your own risk.Subsequent changes are not automatically synchronized so they must be repeated ifnecessary.â€¢ â€¢ 50 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Required permissions It is essential that the SAP interface users used in the context of Template Invoice have thenecessary permissions specified in the Datatransfer documentation.All other (especially technical) permissions for search help and function module calls varydepending on the scope of functions actually used and, if applicable, customer enhancements suchas mapping additional search helps or function modules. Furthermore, additional permissions maybe required after (minor) changes to the parameterization of a function module or search help. Youshould also note that the permissions required for the same operation may differ depending on theSAP system version or additional customer-side permissions checks may exist. For these reasons,this documentation does not contain a list of SAP permissions required for using Template Invoice.If you want to define the permissions required for the interface user as precisely as possible, the authorization trace in SAP enables you to determine all required permission objects for a specifictransaction (possibly in an iterative process).

If this has not been installed in your ELO system, install it now. This packageprovides the class framework, namespaces, and architectural concepts for services, actions, andfunction modules.To start installation, log on to the ELO Java Client as Administrator.You can install the individual packages from the ELO SupportWeb with a single click.Alternative: You can download the package</s> 
<s>containing the .eloinst files on the ELOSupportWeb.Then, install the erp.sap.comaccess package.You will now find the configuration and scripts for the SAP OLE call in the Business Solutionsfolder in the ELO repository.How the script works The implemented ELO script searches for a document with data from SAP (content repository,document ID, and container) as an entry in the SAPPATH field via ELO Indexserver call. The searchstring follows this pattern: <contRep>/<docID>/data.If the script finds hits for this search string, the document is shown depending on the number of hitsand filing location.If there is exactly one hit, the document is shown in the folder structure. If multiple hits are foundor one document is "only" located in the chaos folder, the ELO Java Client search opens and thedocument(s) is (are) shown there.If there are no hits with â€¦./data, the script performs a new search with the container â€¦./data1. Thismethod corresponds to the ArchiveLink protocol method for the get method call.If this search is unsuccessful, another search is run with â€¦./*.Function test â€“ script without SAP To test the function of the script without direct SAP access, you can use the attached testView-woSap.vbs file.Assign this script the content repository and document ID for a document filed to your ELO thatcontains this information in the SAPPATH, and run the script.11 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Creating links from the ELO Intray With this function, you can file documents in the ELO Intray from within an SAP transaction and linkthem to the corresponding SAP business object.InformationThis function is available in ELO Java Client versions 10.07, 11.02, and higher as well as allELO 12 and ELO 20 versions.To configure this, go to transaction OAA4 in your SAP system and select the ELOJCLIENT entryyou created before (see chapter Application Maintenance).A menu opens.Select the item Archive from Frontend.12 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Next, create the following entries Application Maintenance area.

In the SAP context, this path is named SAP repository path and is structured as follows:Component metadataYou have three options for configuring the Component metadata field:If the component ID is entered, e.g. data, the fields are saved in the specified component.If * is entered as the component ID, the fields are saved in all components.If the component ID is blank, the fields of the document (document header) are set.Ignore metadata fieldsIn the Metadata fields are deleted if the entry exists input field, you can define a range of fields thatare left blank if values already exist. The fields are listed separated by commas.Example: INVOICE_DATE, INVOICE_AMOUNT etc.â€¦Overwrite field valuesThis setting in the configuration prevents field values from being overwritten. If you enable thisfunction, field values can be overwritten. Use the input field below it: Prior to update, metadatafields are deleted. The fields are listed separated by commas.Example: INVOICE, INVOICE_STATE etc.â€¦Setting initial valuesIn this configuration parameter, initial values can be written to a field during document filing(component/data) or from the header file (document). You may want to do this to start a workflowvia an ELOas script, for example.

Forexample, the WF_STATE field.The Init metadata value field specifies the fixed value you want to enter into the defined field.For example, the value Start.Advanced You will find more configuration options under</s> 
<s>Advanced.ELO document pathWith the ELO document path, you can file archived documents to your own document path(physical storage location).Example:â€¢ 23 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Log on to the ELO Administration Console and create your own document path.Next, enter the name of the document path into the ELO document path input field in the Advanced menu of the ELO Smart Link configuration. For example, the value sapdocuments. Ifthis value is left blank, the default path is used.Permission (ACL)The configured permissions are applied globally to all filed SAP documents from this contentrepository. To configure multiple permissions, create separate entries for the corresponding groupsor IDs. Use the access right codes used by ELO as the abbreviations for the rights. If using the ID,make sure to enter the # character before the group or user ID.R (Read), W (Write), D (Delete), E (Edit), and P (Permission).InformationStarting with ELO 12, you can use the new right Permission (P). If you use ELO 11 or an olderversion, you cannot use the Permission (P) right. Otherwise, all entries with the Permission(P) right will become invalid! Whenever possible, avoid performing configuration at the userlevel.ELO replication setsAnother configuration option is available for ELO replication sets. You have the option to assign thestored documents from this content repository to one or more ELO replication sets.Option 2: [#]Replication IDUse the replication set name or replication set ID as a configuration parameter in the Contentrepository â€“ Advanced area of ELO Smart Link for SAP. If you leave the parameter field empty, noreplication set will be used. To configure multiple replication sets, use the ENTER key, commas, orthe TAB key after inputting an entry.24 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Key to encrypt and decrypt componentsIf you want to store documents using ELO Smart Link, you can encrypt them before filing to therepository. The AES algorithm of the Java SE platform is used for this. By default, the ELO SmartLink interface generates 128-bit keys. If the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files modulesfrom Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) are installed, 256-bit keys are generated.InformationIf performing a migration for files that were previously 128-bit encrypted, this encryptionmust be maintained, as the system automatically enters the key. Do not switch to a higherencryption type.The encrypted documents are saved with the extension .eloaes. The file streams contain a simpleheader specifying the size and extension of the original document. The encryption process andheader layout can be requested from ELO.ELO Smart Link can also generate a key. These keys are only generated with the AES algorithm. Todo so, proceed as follows:In the Key to encrypt and decrypt components field, enter generate.Apply the configuration settings by clicking the Apply button at the top right and save yourchanges.Open the Advanced content repository configuration again and check whether a key has beenentered into the Key to encrypt and decrypt components input field.WarningIf the encryption code is lost, you will no longer be able to decrypt encrypted documents.Keep this key in a secure location.Encryption algorithmIf encryption</s> 
<s>is used, complete the Encryption algorithm input field. This parameter must beconfigured together with Key to encrypt and decrypt components. The values AES and AES/ECB/NoPadding have been tested by quality assurance.25 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)To ensure compatibility with older installations running Java 7, you have to select AES/ECB/NoPadding for the key to work.If you'd like to use encryption, we recommend setting the value AES/ECB/NoPadding. If you leavethis configuration parameter blank, encryption is not performed.Please noteIf using encryption, documents can only be displayed directly via SAP with direct access viaELO Smart Link. SAP has to be set to the internal SAP document viewer. No other ELO clientcan decrypt the documents. Other functions, such as going straight to the ELO Java Client orELO Web Client, cannot be used either, for example.ELOix function for finding documents to be deletedThe ELOix function for finding documents to be deleted configuration parameter should only beused in case of issues or as needed. In the past, performance issues arose when deletingdocuments for some database systems/ELO versions. In this case, this option can be used. Enter aregistered ELOix function configured in ELO in the Indexserver Scripting Base. This ELO Indexserverfunction should contain optimized searches at the database level.Example: When searching for documents with an Oracle database using the normal approach,timeout errors could occur.The following sample script was developed for this specific case:/*** Example script to replace the SQL statement in componentDelete. * Copy this script file into the archive folder * \Administration\ELO Indexserver Scripting Base\_ALL/*** Statement to be used to find the ELO archive entries of a SAP document.* The placeholders {0} and {1} are replaced by the SAPPATH when the statement is executed.var stmt_findSordForDeleteDocument = "select objid from objekte o, objkeys objk0" + " where" + " o.objid=objk0.parentid" + " and (objk0.okeyname like N'SAPPATH')" // ORACLE: use okeyudata26 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)End points with write permissionsIn this configuration parameter, you can specify host names or IP addresses with write, edit, and/ordelete permissions.Example: + " and ((objk0.okeydata like N'{0}')" + " or (objk0.okeydata like N'{1}/%'))" // ORACLE : + " and (rownum<=10001)" + " and (o.objstatus=0)" + " and (o.objid>1)"/*** Import Indexserver API classesimportPackage(Packages.de.elo.ix.client);/*** Registered function called from ELO Smart Link* @param ec Execution Context* @param args Array of arguments* @returns Table of resultsfunction RF_findSordForDeleteDocument(ec, args) { if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug("RF_findSordForDeleteDocument(" + ec + ", args=" + args); //var repositoryName = args[0]; //var maskName = args[1]; var sappath = args[2]; var db = new Packages.de.elo.ix.jscript.DBConnection(); var ret = db.query(stmt_findSordForDeleteDocument, [sappath, sappath]); if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug(")RF_findSordForDeleteDocument"); return ret;27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Only SAP systems with the IP addresses 10.49.110.187 and 10.49.50.39 may create, change, ordelete documents.Document protectionDocument protection determines whether the content server requires signed access. Normally, thedegree of protection of a document is set by SAP for each document on creation and saving. If it isnot set, the value specified here is used (r = read, u = update, c = create,</s> 
<s>d = delete). The defaultvalue means that only signed access is permitted (maximum security).ELO Web Client URLIf you enter the URL for the ELO Web Client here, all Get access (document calls) are forwarded tothe URL of the ELO Web Client. The configured URL must contain the path to the repository.Example:Entering the ELO Web Client URL allows you to go from the SAP attachment list to the ELO WebClient when opening a document from the attachment list. However, this requires additionalconfigurations in SAP, which are described in the chapter ELO Web Client configuration.Document header nameThe parameter maintained here indicates the name of the document header, which is generatedtogether with the document filed via SAP. If this field is left empty, the default value Document isused. Note the following explanations.http://192.168.0.1:9090/ix-DEMO/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/web/#/archive/28 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)In SAP ArchiveLinkÂ®, two files are always stored for each document filed. The following graphicexplains the default storage process in SAP. In ELO, this is a document and header file, and in SAP itis a component/data and a document.Compatibility modePlease noteOnly use this mode if you are familiar with the consequences and functions.If compatibility mode has been enabled, objects can be requested via the ELO ID instead of theSAPPATH generated by SAP. Furthermore, there are no separate repository entries for separatingdocuments and component properties. The writeBarcodeFile function is also performed differentlythan the standard. In compatibility mode, write access is also disabled. As a result, you cannotcreate any components, for example.Compression modeIf this parameter was enabled, documents to be filed from the SAP system are compressed beforethey are transferred to ELO. The standard ZIP compression algorithm of the Java platform is used,and the files are transferred to ELO zipped.Use Indexserver as fallback if document content type is missingBy default, no content type is transferred in the header when requesting a document from ELO fromthe SAP system, unless a content type is explicitly set in field SAPCONT. This can cause issues withthe SAP system, as the SAP system may set an incorrect extension for the document (e.g. the SAPsystem sets .mdb as the extension).If you enable this menu item, a fallback value will be set based on the file type on the Indexserverand transferred to the SAP system. Please note that this could cause a certification test for ELOSmart Link for SAPÂ® ERP (SAP ArchiveLink) on your SAP system to fail. Another option is tomaintain the SAPCONT field in ELO with the corresponding content type (or mime type).Certificate configuration If the Signature parameter is enabled in the ELO Smart Link Properties menu (see Properties >Enabling signatures), ELO Smart Link for SAP only accepts signed requests from an SAP system.However, the connected SAP system can sign and send its requests with a (public key) certificate.For ELO Smart Link to verify the request, the certificate must be sent from SAP to ELO Smart Link,where it has to be accepted and approved. This ensures only authorized systems have access. Formore information on sending a certificate, refer to</s> 
<s>the section Security settings.We recommend managing certificates sent by SAP systems using the certificate manager. If this isnot possible, you can configure the system to accept sent certificates via the following parameters.Accept next transferred certificate29 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If this parameter is enabled, ELO Smart Link will automatically accept the next certificate sent byan SAP system. The parameter is then disabled again. If using this function, the certificate shouldbe sent from the corresponding SAP system to ELO Smart Link in a timely manner.Accept all certificatesIf this parameter is enabled, ELO Smart Link will automatically accept all incoming certificates.InformationOnly use this mode for test purposes.Other Under Other, you can delete an existing content repository.Apply the changes by selecting the Save changes button in the footer.Certificate manager To work with the certificate manager, you should first set up corresponding content repositories andconfigure them in the connected SAP systems. For more information, refer to the chapter SAPArchiveLinkÂ® configuration.You will find the certificate manager on the toolbar of the ELO Smart Link web interface.30 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The certificate manager is split up into two different areas: Unverified certificates and Verifiedcertificates.If a certificate is sent by an SAP system as described under Security settings, you will find it in the Unverified certificates area. You now have the option to accept the certificate (Approve) or discardit.Once you have accepted the unverified certificate, you will find it under Verified certificates.31 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If additional content repositories have been created for the same SAP system, you can copy theexisting and accepted certificate to another content repository. Under Verified certificates, you canuse the Transfer certificate to another content repository function.Copy content repository When creating a new content repository, you can copy configurations you have already made for anexisting content repository.To do this, you need to enable the option Copy from content repository.If the option is enabled, you can enter the name and description of the new contentrepository and select the content repository whose configuration parameters you want tocopy.Migrating existing configurations With ELO Smart Link, you can import an old ELO Archive Link for SAP configuration or migrateconfigurations from a test system to a live ELO Smart Link system. On the toolbar, you will find the Import and Export entries, which can be used for the following purposes.32 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Exporting a configuration file The Export function allows you to save the current configuration in a directory on your local filesystem.Generated in JSON format, the file contains the complete configuration of ELO Smart Link and cantherefore also act as a backup.Importing a configuration file Please noteThe Overwrite settings function is enabled by default.

This did not have an effect on functionality. During import, theseconfiguration fragments are now allocated logically, but do not result in a completeconfiguration. The incomplete SAP system has to be removed following import. You willhave to first remove the link in the corresponding content repository and then delete theSAP system.Allocation of SAP systems in a content repository is necessary for ELO Connectivity Pack forSAPÂ® ERP functions, such as the index download and barcode upload scenarios.The system indicates the missing parameters and marks the fields with a red border.In addition, all configuration items in all three areas are displayed on three tabs:35 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Information on the SAP systemâ€¢ 36 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)All information on the content repositoriesâ€¢ 37 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)All information on the instance configurationPlease noteIf the Overwrite settings function was disabled, the selected configuration is updated byexisting functions.Migrating ELO Archive Link for SAP configurations ELO Smart Link for SAP is backwards compatible with ELO Archive Link.

The profile parameters used should also beconfigured so that the ELO Application Server cipher suites can be accepted.You will find more information on SAP configuration and the required versions on the SAP supportsite under the following notes:510007 â€“ Additional information about setting up SSL on the Application Server ABAP2287896 â€“ saphttp and SSL: client cipersuites configurationInformationAccessing the SAP Support Launchpad requires an S-user on SAP sites.The ELO server setup must have also been performed with the settings for configuring an SSLconnection with certificate chain.Issues One common reason why the SAP system won't connect to ELO Smart Link for SAPÂ® ERP via SSLeven though certificates have been imported is that no common cipher suite is found duringnegotiation.This is because many SAP systems are only configured for the old TLS protocol version 1.0 asstandard. By updating the kernel and the cryptography library, the SAP system also supports newerprotocols. However, these have to be activated in the configuration (see information in the chapter Basics).To test this scenario, we recommend setting the cipher suite parameters to 967:PFS:HIGH:MEDIUM:+e3DES::EC\_P256:EC\_HIGH.As the SAP system has to be restarted every time changes are made to these profile parameters,we recommend using a very high profile parameter value right from the start.â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)http://launchpad.support.sap.com/http://launchpad.support.sap.com/http://launchpad.support.sap.com/Configuration in the SAP system First, export the certificate from ELO and import it to the corresponding SAP system.

You will now find the configuration for ELO Toolbox inthe Business Solutions Custom folder in ELO. For more information on the configuration, referto the Configuring ELO Toolbox in ELO chapter.Installation information When installing ELO Toolbox, the web app installation may not finish completely. You can tell thatthis is the case if no interface is shown when you open the configuration. To fix this, go to the ELOApplication Server and open the ELOwf status report. You will see the App Manager entry in themenu bar on the right.In the ELO App Manager, the App status indicates whether the web app installation was successful.If this is the case, the entry Installed is shown at the location. If it is set to Archived, you will haveto enable/install, and refresh the web app.6 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Easy storage in SAP This chapter describes the functions for easy storage and the steps required for configuration.Descriptions of functions The easy storage function in SAP offers SAP users the option to file documents in SAP to ELO via theselected object (e.g. purchase order) and link them. This is based on an SAP transport and thesettings in the Generic Object Services area. It is also necessary for customizing ArchiveLink withdocument types, links, etc. for the selected object (SAP BUSINESS object).ELO Toolbox is implemented in Generic Object Services in SAP. In the Generic Object Servicesmenu, you will find the ELO Toolbox item with sub-items Upload selected file(s) from Explorer and Upload selected mail(s) from Outlook.ELO Toolbox has also been implemented in the Generic Object Services toolbar.To use these functions, switch to File Explorer or Microsoft Outlook.7 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Filing from File Explorer Select the desired files in File Explorer. You can select up to ten files at once for upload.Switch to an SAP transaction and in the Generic Object Services menu, click ELO Toolbox >Upload selected file from ExplorerSAP accesses the selected files via the GUI control and provides them to the user in a picklist. You can deselect files you no longer want.Different file types can be filed depending on the SAP ArchiveLink customizing. Documenttypes or file types that are not contained in the customizing cannot be filed. As the file typeused in the example here, Image_Offer.new, is not</s> 
<s>included in the customizing, the file isgrayed out and cannot be imported.After confirming your selection, the documents are filed straight to ELO and an entry is created inthe SAP link tables. The documents are also available in the attachments list for Generic ObjectServices.8 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Filing e-mails from Microsoft Outlook Select the desired e-mails in Microsoft Outlook. You can select up to ten e-mails at once forupload.Switch to an SAP transaction and in the Generic Object Services menu, click ELO Toolbox >Upload selected mail(s) from Outlook.SAP now accesses the selected e-mails via the GUI control and provides them to the user in apick list. You can deselect files you no longer want.After confirming your selection, the e-mails are filed straight to ELO and an entry is created in theSAP link tables. The e-mails are also available in the attachment list for Generic Object Services.9 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Attachment list One major advantage of this filing option is that it applies the file names when using the Explorerfunction, as well as the e-mail subject when using the e-mail function.This information is stored in the title of the linked entries and thus shown in the attachment list. Asa result, the user has more information on the filed document than just the name of the documenttype.Selecting the document type Chapters Adding specific document types and Selecting specific document types describe theconfiguration that enables you to work with multiple document types for each business object.You can define a specific document type for business objects in a whitelist for a file type (e.Â g. PDF).This document type will be used every time you store a document with ELO Toolbox.If you also want to work with multiple document types for an SAP business object and allow theuser to select a specific document type, you can use the configurations described in chapter Selecting specific document types. With the component provided by ELO, the user can select theconfigured document link options in a dialog box when storing a document via ELO Toolbox.10 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Technical implementation â€“ Customizing To implement the easy storage function in your SAP system, you have to make severaladjustments to settings. To be able to make these settings, you have to import the SAP transportyou received when purchasing a license into your SAP system.Extending the Generic Object Services After importing the SAP transport, you can now add the ELO Toolbox menu item to the GenericObject Services.Start the SAP transaction SM30 â€“ Maintain Table Views.Enter the table SGOSATTR into the Table/View field and confirm your input with ENTER or the Maintain button.The next window shows you all attributes of the generic services.Select the New entries button to create a new entry for ELO Toolbox.Menu level â€“ ELO Toolbox Enter the following details:11 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Name of service: ZZELOFUNCDescription: ELO ToolboxQuick info: ELO ToolboxService Type: Service ListIcon: ICON_BIW_SOURCE_SYS_EXTNext service:</s>

You do not have to enable ELO Toolbox forSAP. Once the necessary basic settings have been configured, ELO Toolbox is active for the desiredbusiness object.Document type and linking 14 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If the basic customizing for SAP ArchiveLink contains neither a document type nor a link to abusiness object, the ELO Toolbox functions are disabled (gray).In the basic customizing, create a document type (transaction OAC2) and link (transactionOAC3) this type or an existing document type to the desired business object. In our example,we have used the object BUS2105 â€“ purchase requisition.Document type:Link:Once the customizing settings have been adjusted as described above, the functions of ELOToolbox are active.The file types that can be stored depend on the SAP ArchiveLink customizing. If document typeshave been created for PDF and DOCX file types as described above, PDF documents and DOCXdocuments can be filed.15 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)If you try to upload an XLSX document, for example, the file is marked as "inactive" (gray) in the"Select files" dialog box.This is similar to the function Upload selected mail(s) from Outlook. This menu item in ELO Toolboxis disabled until a document type is configured for SAP ArchiveLink and the right link is created forthe MSG file type.Once the entry has been added to the customizing, the Upload selected mail(s) from Outlookfunction is active and can be used.Configuring specific document types For existing SAP ArchiveLink configurations, there may be multiple identical document types of thesame class set up for one SAP</s> 
<s>business object. To use the ELO Toolbox functions with a specific16 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)document type, configure the document type to be used for a business object in the /ELO/WL_DOCTYPE table.Select Table maintenance â€“ transaction SM30 > '/ELO/WL_DOCTYPE' tableSelecting specific document types If you want the users to be able to select the document types stored in SAP via ELO Toolbox asdescribed in Selecting the document type, you must do the following configurations.Call the ELO transaction /elo/tb_ext.You can use the ELO class /ELO/CL_TB_EXT_DOC_TYPE to display the selection list in ELOToolbox area. Enter the class in the transaction under Class/Interface.In the Object Type column, you can enable the selection of the document type forcorresponding SAP business objects. Enter the business object, e.Â g. BUS2012, or enter * toenable this configuration for all objects.Save your entries. The changes are saved in an SAP transport, which can then be transportedwithin the SAP system chain.This process depends on what customizing has been done to the SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® interface on theSAP system. The user can only select document types or document links that have the samecontent repository.17 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The process is as follows: When a user selects a document in ELO Toolbox (with the functions Upload selected file(s) from Explorer/Upload selected mail(s) from Outlook) and confirms theselected document, this document is uploaded within the SAP system based on the correspondingcustomization (transaction OAC3 links for content repositories). If an entry for the correspondingSAP business object has been added to the whitelist, the document is uploaded based on thisconfiguration (see Adding specific document types). In the next step, if the extension configurationis enabled, the user is presented with the possible document types corresponding to the previousentries (same content repository and document class). After the user selects an entry, acorresponding link entry is created in the SAP link tables (e.Â g. TOA01).Implementation of custom logic It is possible to implement your own logic for this scenario.Please noteWe only recommend this option if you have extensive knowledge of SAP-ABAPprogramming.In this case, it is necessary to create a separate class that implements the /ELO/IF_TB_EXTinterface. You also need to define the method MODIFY_CONNECTION_DATA within the class. Themethod in the extension is executed after the document or e-mail has been uploaded but beforethe link entry is written to the corresponding tables (e.g. TOA01). The class /ELO/CL_TB_EXT_DOC_TYPE uses this to provide a selection of document types that are allowed basedon the content repository and document type (DocType) according to the SAP customization.The entry point does not necessarily have to be used to change the link parameters. It can also beused, e.Â g. to start a custom process in the background or to perform other queries (description) forthe link.Configuring the services depending on the role The toolbox filing functions for user roles can be adjusted with the function /ELO/TB_CONF.18 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)In this table, the most precise match is compared to the roughest</s>

For this function to work, you must have selected a document or folder in the ELOclient that has a valid document ID (ARC_DOC_ID) in the SAPPATH field and therefore represents adocument linked in the SAP system.Now, you can click the Show SAP object button on the SAP tab. If the SAPPATH field in the selectedentry is empty or not available, the two fields SAP_OBJECT and OBJECT_ID are used instead.Depending on the ELO client, there are other requirements that are described in the chapter Jumping from different ELO clients.Required permissions in the SAP system (Jump) To use the Show SAP object function, the user must have the following permissions in the SAPsystem:Execute the transactions /ELO/SHOW and /ELO/SHOW_BODisplay the SAP business object transaction associated with the selected documentExample: A document was selected for an SAP purchase order (BUS2012).

If possible, theseshould not be changed. They are used to control whether corresponding scripts can beloaded in the client. In the standard package, the Solutions group is included in the groupsmentioned above. Changing the default settings in the configuration of these packagesmeans that these changes must also be made manually to the corresponding scripts. Thesesteps would have to be repeated every time you do an update and is therefore notrecommended.Settings for automatic document links This menu item allows you to enable the functions in chapter Automatic linking for a defined usergroup. Enter the corresponding user group. For more details on the function, refer to the chapternamed above.Advanced SAP settings In the first part of these settings, the default settings are entered for all content repositories thatare not managed explicitly.System ID SAP system IDClient SAP client numberUsernameoriginTo ensure users can log on to the SAP system, the origin of the required SAP user namecan be entered here.

Here, ELO requires an object/folder superior to the document that alreadycontains a link to the corresponding SAP object.Example:A folder structure already exists for orders from a specific supplier (C.E.B. Berlin), which alreadycontains documents and where new ones are filed (folder 4500022470). This folder is configuredwith the SAP folder metadata form where the SAP object type (BUS2012 order) and the object ID(purchase order number 4500022470) are entered.If a new document is filed to this structure, ELO can automatically link the document to SAP order 4500022470 and create an entry in the corresponding link table in the SAP system. In this case, theparent folder is the folder titled 4500022470 with the SAP folder metadata form.Requirements To use the Automatic linking function, you need ELO Toolbox as well as the licensed ELOConnectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP with the Datatransfer function. For more information on installingthe ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP â€“ Datatransfer, refer to the relevant documentation. Youalso have to enter a setting in the User name origin field in the toolbox.config configuration.Indirect use of SAP systems If an ELO user uses the Automatic linking function, a link entry is written to the corresponding linktable in SAP when filing a document (e.g. TOA01). In SAP, the creation of this link is considered avalue-adding event, which means that the ELO user performing this action must also have alicensed user in the SAP system.The User name origin field must define where in ELO the corresponding SAP user name can befound. For more information, refer to the chapter Advanced SAP settings.To minimize the risk of a licensing violation, you can take precautions in the ELO Toolboxconfigurations (toolbox.config and autoLinkDocs.config) (see chapter Settings for automaticdocument links). Please note that the customer is responsible for complying with SAP licensingregulations.25 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)file:///builds/documentation/admin/integrations/suite-sap-al/.temp/elo-connectivity-pack-for-sap-datatransferSetting up the event function To automatically link a document, ELO needs a corresponding event function. Once the erp.sap.toolbox has been installed, the required script can be found in the path to the ELO Toolboxpackage.The erp.sap.toolbox.ix.events.AutoLinkDocs script now has to be referenced in the followingdirectory:Administration/IndexServer Scripting Base/_ALL / business_solutionsThe script is enabled after restarting the ELOix components. It is run every time a user files adocument in an ELO client.InformationAutomatic linking is based on an ELOix event interface and uses the asynchronous eventfunction.

The Basic entry form is suggested by default.In the Triggering form configuration, you can determine which metadata forms should trigger adocument link in SAP when filing a document. In addition, you can also define a target form tochange the document to after linking, e.g. to perform an index download afterwards. Rememberthat the selected Target form also contains the fields necessary for establishing a link to SAP (e.g. SAPPATH field in the SAPDATA metadata form).The metadata form is only switched to the target form if ELO has received the information requiredfor a link from a parent element.Source form: Technical name of metadata form or GUID of the form that is used to file thedocument in ELO and start the process of automatic linking.28 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Target form: Technical name of metadata form or GUID of the form the document should switch toafter linking.Note reference to document in target form: If this box is checked, an extended process for changingthe metadata form takes place.

For information on installing the ELO Integration Client in ELO, refer to thecorresponding documentation in the ELO SupportWeb. This documentation describes whichconfigurations are necessary within the SAP system and the required products ELO Toolbox forSAPÂ® ERP and ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP (Indexdownload function).The requirements for using the ELO Integration Client are listed in the chapter Basics.For SAP NetWeaverÂ® and SAP S/4HANAÂ® systems, the ELO Integration Client has been integratedas a pop-up window. It is also possible to embed the ELO Integration Client directly in an SAPtransaction with third-party software, e.Â g. GuiXT or SAP Screen Personas. Chapter SAP ScreenPersonas describes an implementation example for SAP Screen Personas.The pop-up for the ELO Integration Client is displayed as a separate window and can be openedwithin any SAP transaction that provides the Generic Object Services.The Extending the Generic Object Services chapter contains a description of the initial extension ofthe Generic Object Services.The implementation of the pop-up is stored in the class /ELO/CL_GOS_POPUP, which is called by theGOS class /ELO/CL_GOS_INTEGRATION_CLIENT. Depending on the business object and object ID, aURL is requested via the connected ELO system and displayed in the pop-up window.For the functionality to work, the ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP must be installed andconfigured in the SAP system, since the URL is determined via the class /ELO/CL_KE_REQUEST.Important: The structure of a folder path is defined and configured within the Indexdownloadfunction in ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP. When the ELO Integration Client is called, the Indexdownload function is used to query whether the required path (e.g. based on SAP businessobject BUS2012 and the purchase order number) already exists or needs to be created. In the nextstep, the existing or new GUID of the path is integrated into the URL used to call the ELOIntegration Client.32 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Indexdownload transfer To use the ELO Integration Client in an SAP transaction, ELO requires a defined path to thecorresponding SAP document. An RFC destination within the SAP system is required to create thispath. The path defined in ELO Connectivity Pack for SAPÂ® ERP â€“ Indexdownload is used to createthe path.

In addition, the Indexserver must beentered under the destination name.Please noteThe roles used must be valid and added accordingly in the user master record. If the role ofa user role is invalid, a search is performed for the role *.Example for determining the valid entry The following example explains how the most precise match is compared to the roughest match touse the corresponding destination:First, a search is performed for the biggest object type and object role match. Our exampleonly refers to system 4 if the object type is BUS2012 and the role Z_IC_ELO_4 was added inthe user's master record.If no results are found, a check is performed to determine whether an entry with theavailable object type and role exists. Therefore, all users who do not have the role Z_IC_ELO_4 for the object type BUS2012 are forwarded to system 3.If there is no match here either, a search is performed for a result in the object type * and thecorresponding role. Therefore, if the user has the role Z_IC_ELO_2, the user is forwarded tosystem 2 independently of the object type.A default entry should be created so that a destination can be referred to if there is no match,in this example system 1.RF_erp_sap_indexdownload_service_CreatePath36 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Configuring the ELO Integration Client in ELO In the next step, you need to configure the ELO Integration Client in the administration folder inELO.Open the configuration file elo.integration.Client at the following path:Administration//ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.ClientIf the JSON file does not exist, you need to create it first.

The main characteristic of a BAdI is that it provides a mechanism tochange the functionality of a well-defined business function (e.g. a BAPI) without makingchanges to the delivered source code.

This is deactivated by default since other BAdIs may be activated. If this is thecase, you need to deactivate these first and then execute them in the BAdI provided by ELO.Maintaining the Generic Object Services In the last step, you need to set up the ELO Integration Client in the Generic Object Services.

A dynpro is a repository object and isalways a component of an ABAP program. It consists of the screen with its screen elementsand the dynpro flow logic. Dynpro fields are assigned to the screen elements." (Source: SAPHelp Portal)If the user switches to another object (e.g. a different purchase order) without closing the window,the ELO Integration Client, which remains in the foreground, updates automatically.

This is due to a different controlexecuted by the GOS (Generic Object Services) that ELO has no control over. In this case, theELO Integration Client will be closed.Please note that the dynpro control of some more complex transactions (e.g. me23n) makes itnecessary to update the pop-up independently of the main dynpro. A new session is created in thebackground and the pop-up data is updated there. The user does not see this and it has no effect onother SAP modules that are in use. To use this function, you need to activate a BAdIimplementation of the BAdI GOS_SRV_SELECT.Switch to one of the transactions SA38, SE38, or SE80 and execute the program /ELO/GOS_BADI provided with the SAP transport.42 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)As other BAdI implementations may be activated for the BAdI GOS_SRV_SELECT, the BAdIimplementation /ELO/GOS_POPUP provided by ELO is inactive by default.

Thisimplementation example uses the transaction me23n â€“ Display purchase order.A blue line appears at the top of the transaction window. If you hover over this blue line, theSAP Screen Personas icon appears.Click the icon to open the SAP Screen Personas</s> 
<s>â€“ My Flavors â€“ Original Screen window.To create a new flavor, click the plus icon and enter a name and a description for the flavor. Inthis example, we used the following data:Name: ELO Integration Client â€“ me23nDescription: ELO Integration Client â€“ Purchase Order me23nSave the name and description.51 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The SAP Screen Personas window switches to the Edit Flavor â€“ ELO Integration Client â€“ me23nmenu.Now you have to select where you want to embed the ELO Integration Client within thetransaction. In the SAP Screen Personas menu, select Insert and then HTML Viewer.The HTML Viewer window opens.Leave the URL entry blank and confirm with Done.A separate frame for the HTML Viewer appears, which you can now place on the screen of thetransaction. You can also adjust the size of the frame.InformationYou can also resize the individual transaction frames. Note, however, that framescontain other frames that you may also need to resize as a result.Save your settings with Save at the top right corner and select Exit to close editing mode.Script development Once you have created the flavor, you need to create a script for it.Open the SAP Screen Personas menu again.Select the flavor you just created, ELO Integration Client â€“ me23n, and click the Scriptingbutton.This opens a scripting window. Select the button Create Script here.As we want the script to run when the transaction is refreshed (screen event), we will namethe script here onAfterRefresh.Next, we need to read the ID of the HTML viewer we just created. After creating the script,click Inspector and then the Object Selector icon.52 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Click the HTML viewer you just created to display the ID in the Inspector info area.Use the icon to the left of the ID to transfer the value to the script window.Copy the following script and correct the ID value of the HTML viewer (source code: wnd[0]/usr/htmlViewerPersonas_161244953637589) which you just applied.try { var htmlViewer = session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/htmlViewerPersonas_161244953637589") var rfc = session.createRFC("/ELO/GET_URL_FROM_MEMORY"); rfc.requestResults(["RV_URL"]);53 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Use the Save button to save your changes.You can test the previous configuration steps using the Execute.Assigning an event in a flavor Close the Scripting window after you have saved the script.

The user can view the flavor byselecting the SAP Screen Personas icon.The user can set this flavor as the default with the star icon.Note that the views in WebGUI and SAP GUI may be different. In particular, the size of the HTMLviewer window may differ and so you may need to adjust the size.Assigning SAP permissions To give users access to the new flavor, you still need to assign the appropriate permissions or roles.Switch to the administration interface of SAP Screen Personas using the transaction code /n/Personas/admin.55 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Under Object Maintenance, search for the flavor you created and switch to the Assignmentstab.You can assign permissions for users or SAP roles here.Save your entries by selecting the floppy disk icon.GuiXT As an alternative to integration via custom SAP Screen Personas flavors, the ELO Integration Clientcan also be embedded directly in an SAP transaction within the SAP GUI for Windows (SAP GUI)using GuiXT. This chapter describes an example implementation using GuiXT.InformationGuiXT allows you to simplify SAP ERP forms and adapt them to the requirements ofindividual user groups without having to modify SAP programs or forms (dynpros).

This documentation is not GuiXT developer documentation, but requires prior knowledgeof GuiXT. The additional component Controls is required. This can be purchased with acorresponding license from Synactive. The Controls component can be used to call externalprograms, functions, and scripts.57 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Set an RFC user with sufficient permissions in the GuiXT profile. You can view a list of therequired permissions on the Synactive website.The menu item Tools > Check RFC Connection can be used to check whether a connectioncan be established.The path to the GuiXT scripts must be known, i.e. must have been created. This is where youwill store the scripts used to execute GuiXT.Furthermore, the corresponding path to an external VBS/JavaScript script file must be storedin the profile, since a VB script must also be included for the desired functionality in additionto the actual GuiXT script. If this file doesn't exist, it needs to be created.You need to modify the path and the name of the .vbs file to meet your own requirements.58 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)https://www.synactive.com/docu_e/doc_rfc.htmlhttps://www.synactive.com/docu_e/doc_rfc.htmlhttps://www.synactive.com/docu_e/doc_rfc.htmlInformationIf you are already using GuiXT, use your script paths.

This makes sense, forexample, if there are different groups of users in SAP. I.e. those who should have access to theIntegration Client, and those who should not use it and therefore should not be able to view it.Up to version 1.0.8 This functionality is not available in all versions of the ELO Toolbox for SAPÂ® ERP < 1.0.8.From version 1.0.8 To configure which applications should be activated/deactivated or switched to hidden for a usergroup, a configuration must be made using the transaction /N/ELO/TB_CONF. This configuration isempty as default, and therefore all applications in ELO Toolbox for SAPÂ® ERP are available tousers.The basis for the configuration table looks like this:Name MeaningApplication Application in the toolbox to which the configuration should be applied.ObjecttypeBus object for which the entry is validRole Role used to identify the user group and for which the entry should be appliedinact. statBehavior of the assigned application in the affected object to the associated user rolein the case inact.statact.statusBehavior of the assigned application in the affected object to the associated user rolein the case act.statusInformationThe column inact. stat controls how the application should behave if the object is either notavailable (for example, the Purchase order object has not yet been saved) or if the userâ€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ 63 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ®</s> 
<s>(SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)does not have valid permission based on their user role. There is no permission if the usedrole is not assigned or it has expired.The column act.status determines how the application should behave if the user has theappropriate permission and the object is available.The user roles must first be created to configure which user can use which applications. These userroles can then be added to the user in the user master record (transaction: su01).Example for determining the valid entry using the Integration Client In the following example, we explain how the most precise match can be compared to the roughestmatch to control the corresponding application, depending on the set status:First, the biggest object type and role match is sought for each set application. In ourexample, ELO Integration Client is shown as available for selection in the toolbox if theobject type is BUS2012 and the role Z_IC_ELO has been added to the user's master record. Ifthe object has the status inactive then the ELO Integration Client entry is switched toinactive.If no results are found, a check is performed to determine whether an entry with theavailable object type and role * exists.If there is no match here either, a search is performed for a result for the object type * andthe suitable role Z_IC_ELO, therefore, the respective value given (inactive/active/hidden) isapplied independently of the object type.If there is no match there either, a result for the object type * and the role * is sought,therefore the respective value given (inactive/active/hidden) is applied independently of theobject type and independently of the role.If no matching entry is found, because no entry exists for object type * and role *, theapplication is shown as default.64 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)Information and tips This chapter contains additional useful information. You will learn how to disable securityinformation in the SAP GUI as well as how to store documents with Generic Object Services.Security information in the SAP GUI When using the Upload selected file(s) from Explorer and Upload selected mail(s) from Outlookfunctions, a security prompt may appear depending on how the local SAP GUI client is configured.With the Allow button, you enable the function to upload a document.Check the box next to Remember My Decision to prevent the message from appearing again.However, the security prompt is file-dependent in this case: If the user opens a document fromwithin another transaction, the security prompt will appear again. The local system administratorcan choose between two SAP GUI settings to disable the message.Open the Options menu item for your SAP logon using the menu icon.65 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)The SAP GUI Optionsâ€“ SAP Logon dialog box opens.On the left side of the dialog box, select Security > Security Settings.

If you have connection problems,contact your network administrator. This port is self-defined; do not confuse it with the portof the added ELO DocXtractor component.PrimaryKeyColumns This configuration entry is required if ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor has to generate aprimary key for the data sets before making an entry to the ELO DocXtractor matching data.Enter the table name and the column in the following convention: Table|Column. For additionaltables and columns, use a semicolon as a separator. If an entry is specified for a table, a new dataset is inserted in the specified column of the value max+1 during the Insert action.Example: Invoice With a standard ELO DocXtractor Invoice installation, a combination of company code and vendorrepresent the unique key for the vendor. If you want to provide all bank accounts per vendor to ELODocXtractor, this would result in a primary key violation. To be able to save all bank accounts, weadd the column VEPK to the SFIVENDOR* table in this case. This additional column is also added tothe Unique Index of the table and the matching server configuration. As the values for this columndon't come from the ERP system, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor generates a unique key.*The value for the configuration entry for the case above would then be: SFI_VENDOR|VE_PK.InformationYou also need to consider the settings in DocXtractor: Make the VE_PK column known as theprimary key to the MatchingServer in the DocXtractor Document Manager.ReloadTables In this configuration entry, you can define which tables or views the matching server should reloadwhen changes are made to data in a specific table. The value of the configuration entry is a list ofvalues separated by semicolons.For the Invoice case in which order data requires a reload of the order view after changes to itemdata, the value looks like this:<Table>|<Table or View 1>Â¶<Table or View 2>Â¶...<Table or View n>11 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)SaveDataDir (optional) If this configuration entry has been set, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor saves the datatransferred from the ERP system for debugging in the directory specified in the configuration entry.Separator The defined column separator the data is transferred with.User This user name is used for authentication between the ERP system (e.g. an SAP system) and theERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor interface.InformationThe user does not have to be a system-specific ERP user. However, the user has to beentered in the ERP system configuration for authentication/connection. You will find thisconfiguration taking connecting to an SAP system as an example in the section Installationand configuration: Configuring a destination.WriteLogFile Specifies whether a log file should be written per import when importing data.Please noteWriting log files results in significant decreases in performance.

The advantage of this is that the data isavailable to the ELO DocXtractor system right away without reloading. However, each time a dataset is inserted, the matching server index is optimized. As a result, you can only insert approx. 10data sets per second. This is especially important to remember when initially filling the matchingdatabase.Besides \insert, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor also provides an \insertDB function. As thedata is written directly to the database, the matching server index does not have to be optimizedafter every Insert. Measurements have shown that you can insert approximately 350-400 data setsper second in the matching database in this way.We therefore do not recommend transferring</s> 
<s>more than2,000 data sets per \insert call (corresponding to approx. 3-4 minutes) and100,000 data sets per \insertDB call (corresponding to approx. 3-4 minutes).In any case, the values should be adapted to the actual performance of the specific system.Please noteIf you use an ELO DocXtractor version lower than 5.0 SP01, do not submit more than 100,000data sets per call. This kind of call would very likely fail and cause a communication error inSAP. Use the filter function or an Insert per company code.In both cases, make sure that the web service call does not result in a timeout when the call isperformed within the ERP system.Note regarding the SFI_ORDER_ITEM table The performance difference between \insert and \insertDB isn't as significant with the SFI_ORDER_ITEM table. The \insert function is much faster, as no key columns are defined for thetable in the matching server, making entries to the matching server easier.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 16 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLinkÂ® (SAP NetWeaverÂ® & SAP S/4HANAÂ®)SAP NetweaverÂ® und SAP S/4HANAÂ®SAP NetWeaverÂ® and SAP S/4HANAÂ®This chapter explains how to connect ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor to SAP NetWeaverÂ®and SAP S/4HANAÂ® systems.InformationUsing ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor requires outgoing HTTP communicationcapabilities.

See the Initial startup chapter for more details.The following configurations are available:Data provider: Select which data the data provider should determine and send to the defineddestination. You can choose order data, vendor data, or your own class. If you use your own class,you have to maintain it. The section Installation and configuration: Data provider per BO describeshow to maintain custom classes.Data selection: With the All entries parameter, you can display or transmit the result unfiltered.This is similar to a selection on the database with *. However, if you select Restrict to object ID, theselection is restricted to this input. The ObjectID always depends on the SAP business object.

<s>ELO CMIS | Installation & operationELO CMISInstallation & operationTable of contentsOperationOverview Differences between the ELO standard and the CMIS interface CMIS functions that are not supported Search Appendix: Initial settings with OpenCMIS Workbench 2 ELO CMISOperationOverview Introduction to the technology The interface is based on a JSR-compatible web application combined with the Apache Chemistrystack latest version (12.0-SNAPSHOT). In this context, the library package suggested by Chemistryis used. This includes the OpenCMIS libraries of the Chemistry project as well as the JAX-WSlibraries for the SOAP binding.System requirements and specifications You need to take the following system requirements and specifications into account:System Requirements Versions usedJavaRuntimeJava 13 and later 13.0.1ServerengineELO CMIS 21.1 and previous versions require Servlet API 4.0 or othercompatible servlet container (for instance Tomcat 9.0.31).Tomcat 9.0.31ELO CMIS since version 21.3 requires Servlet API 5.0 or othercompatible servlet container (for instance Tomcat 10.0.27).Tomcat 10.0.27ELO Version 11 and higherIf ELO CMIS connects to an ELO Indexserver 20 or earlier (ELO 11, ELO12, ELO 20), the interface provided by the module will be CMIS API1.0.If ELO CMIS connects to an ELO Indexserver 21 or later and if the cmisVersion parameter in the configuration is set to 1.1, the interfaceprovided by the module will be CMIS API 1.1.Memory &CPUDepending on load. However, we recommend 250 MB for the web appand 5 MB for each user. This value must be increased due to theELOix sessions, as the CMIS application is not used for managingsession data. The recommended load per user is 30 MB. This valuemay need to be scaled up to take into account larger documentuploads, as binding can cause binary data to be cached to memory.OperatingsystemSee Java VMWindows 2012R2, LinuxHDDThe interface caches data to the file system when uploadingdocuments. This needs to be taken into account when computing theload per user.3 ELO CMISSystem Requirements Versions usedCMISClientCMIS Client 1.0 or 1.1 with an AtomPub, SOAPOpenCMISWorkbench 1.1(AtomPub,SOAP), SoapUIInstallation The installation describes the procedure for a Tomcat-compatible servlet container.The installation behaves just like other ELO web applications.First, you have to stop the ELO Server Engine/Servlet Container.Place the web application from the installation package (cmis.war) in the webapps folder.Change the name of the web application, if necessary.4 ELO CMISCreate a context descriptor for the web applications in the conf//Catalina//localhost directory.The name of the descriptor must be identical to the base name of the application.Modify the parameters of the context descriptor.Copy the config.xml and logback.xml files to the configuration directory and modify asrequired.Import the provided script RF_ELOcmis_getCheckedOutDocs.js and load it in each ELOIndexserver, which has to be connected:a) Copy this script at the location Â¶AdministrationÂ¶IndexServer Scripting BaseÂ¶_ALL.b) Reload the ELO Indexserver scripts.Configuration parameters Global parameters Name Description Examplerepositories.enabled List of active repositories, separated with a comma reponame1,reponame2Repository-specific parameters Name Description Example<reponame>.idRepository ID (ID for the CMISinterface)5 ELO CMISName Description Example<reponame>.name Repository name ELO20<reponame>.indexserverurl ELO Indexserver URLhttp://localhost:9090/ix-ELO20/ix<reponame>.usernameELO user name (administrative user).This entry is required for analternative authenticationmechanism described in the Authentication section.EloService<reponame>.passwordELO password.

Anyother value or no value at all willresult in a CMIS 1.0 interface.1.16 ELO CMISName Description ExampleWith this parameter, no connection tothe Indexservers is established whencalling the getRepositories method.InformationSome configuration entries present in previous ELO CMIS versions were obsolete and havebeen removed in ELO CMIS version 21.00.010. Three of them were used to enable somefunctions that are now enabled by default: supportfoldertree, supportdescendants, and supportdeletecontentstream. Another entry was used to define sub-repositories in theconfiguration file: subrepositories.Authentication Normal authentication with ELO user In standard cases, the CMIS authentication information sent with the requests corresponds to agiven ELO user and their password. The rights and privileges of this user are considered for allactions they perform within the repository.Alternative authentication mechanism with 'runAs' An alternative authentication mechanism exists for some special cases, like the execution ofautomatic tasks, which should be executed with different roles and users. For such a scenario, theuse of user passwords is unpractical: Authentication is then based on a single ELO administrativeaccount that performs a runAs for the users. The parameters username and password in theconfiguration file allow the system to authenticate the administrative user. The parameter secret inthe configuration defines a passphrase, which has to be used in CMIS requests instead of the userâ€™spassword.Note that the normal authentication mechanism can also be performed simultaneously for userswho need to perform interactive actions thanks to a peer logon/password.Version information ELO CMIS versions Previously, an ELO CMIS release (e.g. ELO CMISÂ 11, ELO CMIS 12, etc.) was built for each ELOrelease (e.g. ELOÂ 11, ELOÂ 12, ELOÂ 20, etc.). From ELO CMIS 21, a single release will be maintained,which can serve all ELO versions. In practice, ELO CMISÂ 21 can connect with ELOÂ 12, ELOÂ 20, andELOÂ 21.7 ELO CMISELO versions and CMIS APIs ELO 20 and previous versions are compliant with CMIS API 1.0. CMIS API 1.1 has been applied sinceELOÂ 21.Supported bindings AtomPub and SOAP/WSDL bindings are supported. The JSON binding is not supported.8 ELO CMISDifferences between the ELO standard and the CMISinterface Object types CMIS requires object types to have unique identifiers (=TypeID). Every object type can inherit fromthe document or folder base class. This does not follow the ELO principle that allows a metadataform to be assigned to a document or a folder. Metadata form names are passed on. If there is ametadata form named MetadataForm1 that</s> 
<s>is only assigned to folders, this name will always beused. If the metadata form is assigned to documents as well as folders, then two types aregenerated: Metadata Form1 for documents and Metadata Form1_Folder for folders.Types can be created and deleted, but not updated. Note that all types have to inherit the baseclass document or folder. Inheritance between types isnâ€™t allowed: Each type has a typeMutability.create property set to false.Object IDs CMIS folder IDs correspond to their object GUID in ELO. CMIS document IDs follow this format: <objectGUID>_<DocGUID>. Each document version is therefore assigned a unique ID as per theCMIS specification. The ID of the private working copy follows the same format but has the prefix PWC.Please noteIn the previous ELO CMIS versions, the CMIS ID was always the corresponding ELO objectGUID, event for the documents with content. This new CMIS ID format is an intern aspect,which doesnâ€™t impact the work with ELO CMIS, through CMIS clients. Nevertheless, this newformat can lead to problems for third-party modules, which persist such information fromCMIS servers in order to implement some functionalities, absent from the CMISspecification, like workflows for instance. In this case, the third-party moduleâ€™s database hasto be updated in order to replace the old CMIS ID with the new one for all entriescorresponding to a document with content. This update can easily be done since the old IDcorresponds to the CMIS property versionSeriesId. Running the method getObjectOfLatestVersion with the old CMIS ID as parameter allows to retrieve the new CMISID.9 ELO CMISDocument name CMIS expects the object in repository to have exactly the same name as the file that was checkedin. ELO removes the extension and keeps only the main part to name the newly created object inthe repository.Versions Since ELO doesnâ€™t have private working copies, PWC corresponds to the last version, but it isassigned a unique ID thanks to its prefix PWC. Therefore, PWC is not the latest version, inaccordance with the CMIS specification.Relationships Relationships arenâ€™t supported.Renditions Renditions arenâ€™t supported.Policies Policies arenâ€™t supported.Change tokens Change tokens arenâ€™t supported.ItemsItems are available for ELO 21 and higher, in accordance with CMIS API 1.1.Secondary types Secondary types are available for ELO 21 and higher, in accordance with CMIS API 1.1. Note that,like the primary types, the secondary types can also be searched.However, ELO doesnâ€™t have any similar concept. The secondary type implementation thereforerelies on dynamic modifications of the metadata forms. These modifications are transparent in10 ELO CMISCMIS and CMIS types donâ€™t show any changes. Nevertheless, note that ELO metadata forms may bemodified and extended with further properties using secondary types.When creating a secondary type, its description wonâ€™t be saved for technical reasons.Map fields The additional information in ELO (map fields) is currently not supported.Special characters As CMIS clients are to some extent also file system clients, special characters such as <>:"/\|?* arenot supported. However, these do occur in ELO. These objects are currently not transferred to CMISclients.Historical metadata Historical metadata is returned in compliance with the CMIS specification.Activities and workflows There is currently no</s> 
<s>function on the CMIS ports that can map activities and workflows.Types of metadata fields The following types defined in the CMIS specification arenâ€™t available in ELO and thus are convertedto string: BOOLEAN, ID, HTML, URI.ELO type CMIS typeISO date DATETIMENumber, number 0 decimal places NUMBERNumber with fixed width DECIMAL (32-BIT)Other types STRINGXDateFor each repository object, in addition to the CMIS and type-related properties, ELO CMIS alsoprovides an additional ELO-specific property: eloproperty:date which corresponds to the ELO xdateproperty.CachingTo avoid unnecessary and numerous requests, ELO CMIS includes a system of caches:a cache containing the IDs of the objects in the repositories: this cache allows to checkwithout expensive requests that no access is done outside the CMIS repository (definedthanks to the rootfolderid configuration parameter).A cache containing the CMIS types (and the associated ELO DocMasks and Aspects).â€¢ â€¢ 11 ELO CMISThese caches are of course updated if changes are made to the structure or types using CMISmethods. If changes are made outside ELO CMIS (with an ELO client, ELO Java Client or ELOAdministration Console for example), the caches must be refreshed using the 'Clear caches control.This control is available for each repository on the ELO CMIS status page.12 ELO CMISCMIS functions that are not supported Object Service Function DescriptioncreateRelationship Creates a relationship object of the specified type.createPolicy Creates a policy object of the specified type.getRenditionsGets the list of associated renditions for the specified object. Only renditionproperties are returned, not rendition streams.Policy Service Function DescriptionapplyPolicy Applies a specified policy to an object.getAppliedPolicy Gets the list of policies currently applied to the specified object.removePolicy Removes a specified policy from an object.Type Service Function DescriptionupdateType Updates a type definition.Discovery Service Function DescriptiongetContentChangesGets a list of content changes. This service is intended to be used by searchcrawlers or other applications that need to efficiently understand what haschanged in the repository.13 ELO CMISSearch DiscoveryService/query are used to support searches.However, these are limited to searches within folders, basic properties such as short text, or theELO metadata.The cmis:name is always made up of the short text followed by the extension of the documentversion (for file system CMIS clients). However, this is not available for the search in this form. It isonly possible to search the cmis:name without the extension.FROM In FROM expressions, the following targets are supported:cmis:folder Search for folders onlycmis:document Search for documents onlyelo:<METADATA_FORM>Search for items with metadata form <METADATA_FORM>. The metadataform name or the Mask ID are supported.WHERE In WHERE expressions, the following criteria are supported:cmis:nameSearch according to the item name. Wildcards (%) are supported if theLIKE operator is used.cmis:objectId Filter search result by object IDcmis:objectTypeId Search according to the metadata form namecmis:creationDateSearch according to the creation date of the item. Here, you can searchaccording to ISO Strings (YYYYMMDD) or with TIMESTAMP '<string>' (theexact syntax is documented in the CMIS specification). A special featureof ELO is the search within an interval. Beside ISO strings, searcheswithin a range are also supported. For instance, a search for 20180101â€¦20191231 will return all elements which were created between January2018 and December 2019 (the</s> 
<s>short request 201801â€¦201912 willactually return the same result).cmis:lastModificationDateSearch according to the last date the item was modified. For the syntax,see cmis:creationDate.elo:<METADATA_FIELD>Search according to values from metadata fields. Search values cancontain escaped single quotes. Supported escape characters arebackslash or (a second) single quote.IN_FOLDER Search within a given folder (see Example 1).The AND and OR operators are supported if they follow the pattern:14 ELO CMISWHERE exp1 AND exp2 AND (exp3 OR exp4 OR â€¦) AND exp5 AND (exp6 OR exp7 OR â€¦) AND â€¦The following has to be considered when writing a WHERE expression:If there is at least one AND operator, OR operators have to be encapsulated in blocks withparentheses.No block encapsulated in another block.As many AND and OR operators as needed: nevertheless consider performance issues; theELO search API isnâ€™t designed for such SQL-Like WHERE expressions with OR operators usedthis way. To mimic this behavior, a dedicated search has to be made for each OR expression.The global result is computed and sorted afterwards. Considering this, a complex WHEREexpression can lead to a significant latency.The LIKE predicates are case-insensitive:A predicate of the form â€¦ where cmis:name LIKE â€˜a%â€™ â€¦Â¶ will match a cmis:name starting with a or ORDER BY The ORDER BY expression supports the following criteria:cmis:XXXAll CMIS item properties (refer to the CMIS specification): e.g. cmisÂ :nameor cmis:creationDateelo:<METADATA_FIELD> Order according to values from metadata fieldsExamples Example 1: Searching for documents within a folderSELECT \* FROM cmis:document WHERE IN\_FOLDER('(C9A6CC1D-C820-D957-5712-C2C629E973EF)')Example 2: Searching for documents using the short textSELECT \* FROM cmis:document WHERE cmis:name LIKE 'Test%'Example 3: Searching using a metadata form and a metadata fieldSELECT \* FROM elo:Email WHERE elo:ELOOUTL2 = '222'Example 4: Searching for documents created after March 18, 2018SELECT \* FROM cmis:document WHERE cmis:creationDate \> TIMESTAMP '2018-03-18T00:00:00.000'SELECT \* FROM cmis:document WHERE cmis:creationDate = '20180318â€¦'Example 5: Searching for documents within a folderSELECT \* FROM cmis:document WHERE IN\_FOLDER('(C9A6CC1D-C820-D957-5712-C2C629E973EF)')â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 15 ELO CMISAppendix: Initial settings with OpenCMIS Workbench Sample settings to help you get started.Current version for download: https://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.htmlJava 8 version tested with SOAP: http://archive.apache.org/dist/chemistry/opencmis/0.7.0/16 ELO CMIShttps://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.htmlhttps://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.htmlhttp://archive.apache.org/dist/chemistry/opencmis/0.7.0/http://archive.apache.org/dist/chemistry/opencmis/0.7.0/17 ELO CMISFLO CMIS= Login x!| Basic | ExpertURL: hittp://localhost:9090/elocmis/services/RepositoryService?wsdlBinding: () AtomPub (@) WebSernices () BrowserUsername: administratorPassword: ***Authentication: () None @) Standard (|) NTLM () OAuth 2.0 (Bearer Token)Compression: @) On () OffClient Compression: () On Â©@ OffCookies: @) On () Off_â€”-[ Load Repositories1000| Login18 ELO CMISas | ELO CMIS= Login x!| Basic | ExpertURL: hittp://localhost:9090/elocmis/services11/RepositoryService?wsdlBinding: () AtomPub (@) WebSernices () BrowserUsername: administratorPassword: ***Authentication: () None @) Standard (|) NTLM () OAuth 2.0 (Bearer Token)Compression: @) On () OffClient Compression: () On Â©@ OffCookies: @) On () Off_â€”-[ Load Repositories1000| Login Table of contents Operation Overview Introduction to the technology System requirements and specifications Installation Configuration parameters Global parameters Repository-specific parameters Authentication Normal authentication with ELO user Alternative authentication mechanism with 'runAs' Version information ELO CMIS versions ELO versions and CMIS APIs Supported bindings Differences between the ELO standard and the CMIS interface Object types Object IDs Document name Versions Relationships Renditions Policies Change tokens Items Secondary types Map fields Special characters Historical metadata Activities and workflows Types</s>

As with other ELO applications, youhave to create a config.xml and a log4j.properties file and configure them in the Tomcat. The config.xml file only contains the parameters required for accessing the ELO Indexserver (IX URL)and the logon data for the COLD user as well as the base path for the configuration. All otherconfiguration data is in the repository. If the base path is blank, /Administration/ELOcold is appliedby default.ELO COLD can process multiple COLD data streams in parallel. Separate configurations are createdfor each data stream, which define e.g. the input directories, the indexÂ data, or the filing location.This data is filed to the base folder ELOcold as a child folder.On start-up, the system reads all configurations within ELOcold and starts a separate processingthread for each of them. The individual converters are read and created from the configuration. Theprocessing pipeline is then started.The configuration is located in the extra text of the configuration folder.<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd"><properties><entry key="url">http://srvtdev03:6020/ix-elo100/ix</entry><entry key="user">Administrator</entry><entry key="password">123</entry></properties>4 ELO COLDCOLD Pipeline The following presents and explains a configuration for a COLD pipeline (channel). Custom modulesmay require additional configuration settings. As the configuration is transferred to the modulescompletely, it can be easily extended.Global settings are defined in the first section. To keep an overview of what files have already beenprocessed and which haven't in case the program closes, the files are moved to differentdirectories.InputDir=D:\\Temp\\ColdImportWorkDir=D:\\Temp\\ColdWorkDeletedDir=D:\\Temp\\ColdDeletedRetryDir=D:\\Temp\\ColdRetryErrorDir=D:\\Temp\\ColdErrorCharset=Cp437PageProcessor=com.elo.cold.processors.FCFCPageProcessorFileIterator=com.elo.cold.processors.FileIteratorBaseLineReader=com.elo.cold.processors.utils.FCFCByteLineReaderIndexer=com.elo.cold.processors.SimpleMatchIndexerIndexer.MatchLast=my very important customer name at the end of the invoiceIndexer.LineMatcher1=KDNRÂ¶1Â¶15Â¶5Â¶10Indexer.LineMatcher2=INT.RENRÂ¶1Â¶*Â¶RECHNUNGS-NR...:[ ]{1,5}([0-9]+)Indexer.LineMatcher3=PHONEÂ¶1Â¶*Â¶TELEFON:[ ]{1,5}([0-9|\-]{6,15})Indexer.LineMatcher4=DESTINATIONÂ¶1Â¶*Â¶RECHNUNGS-NR...:[ ]{1,5}([0-9]{5})Indexer.LineMatcher5=COMBINEDÂ¶Rech={INT.RENR} und Tel={PHONE}Indexer.Key=RENRÂ¶RE:{INT.RENR}Renderer=com.elo.cold.processors.RendererBaseRenderer.PageSize=A4Renderer.TopMargin=30Renderer.LeftMargin=20Renderer.FontSize=7Renderer.LineMargin=9Archiver=com.elo.cold.processors.ArchiverBaseArchiver.Root=/COLD/{DESTINATION}/2017.01Archiver.Mask=BARCODEArchiver.Subject=Cold: {BARC}5 ELO COLDData source The data source is determined via the FileIterator configuration. The standard class for readingdirectories described below is used as the default setting. However, custom classes can be createdand configured, which can use e.g.Â a database as the data source.InputDir contains the finished COLD data streams. It may only contain complete, closed files. Forthis reason, the files should not be created in this directory. Instead, you should create them in aparallel directory and move (and not copy) them to InputDir upon completion.Once the system begins processing a file, it is moved from InputDir to WorkDir. This ensures that,in case of a file error, the same file isn't imported over and over again, flooding the repository withduplicates. The file remains there during the entire time it is being processed.After import, the file is moved to DeletedDir. This directory can be deleted automatically or movedto a backup. These files are no longer relevant for ELO COLD. If an error occurs during import, thefile is moved to ErrorDir instead of DeletedDir. The administration can decide what to do with thefiles located here (e.g. correct, file again).If import is interrupted or cannot be completed due to an error, the file can be submitted</s> 
<s>for filingagain. It is moved to the RetryDir directory. If a unique key is entered to the channel definition(Indexer.Key), the system can recognize what documents have already been filed and which stillhave to be processed. If no unique key is entered, this directory is ignored.Page separation The LineReader and PageProcessor are responsible for reading lines and separating pages. Thestandard solution offers two different implementations.Normal data streams with line breaks \r\n and FormFeed page separation can be read using com.elo.cold.processors.utils.ByteLineReader and com.elo.cold.processors.SimplePageProcessor.Data streams containing control characters in the first column of each line can be processedwith com.elo.cold.processors.utils.FCFCByteLineReader and com.elo.cold.processors.FCFCPageProcessor. Normally, you will have to derive a customclass for interpreting the different control sequences.The LineReader is responsible for reading files line by line. If necessary, the character set is alsoconverted. From this point on, the system only works with Unicode. The LineReader also indicateswhether the end of a page or file has been reached. The end of a file is always interpreted as theimplicit end of a page. It is not possible to separate one page over multiple files.The PageProcessor gathers the read lines until the end of a page is reached. The text pagegenerated is then forwarded to the next pipeline step.Document separation The workflow gathers pages from the PageProcessor until the Indexer signalizes a documentchange. This change can take place on recognition of the first page or on recognition of the lastâ€¢ â€¢ 6 ELO COLDpage. Mixed operation is also possible, as long as it remains clear which document pages belongto. To identify the first or last page of a document, the Indexer function qualifyPage is called foreach page. The Indexer can return whether it has recognized a start or end page. By default, youcan search for specific texts indicated via the configuration parameters Indexer.MatchFirst and Indexer.MatchLast.Extracting index values Once all text pages of a document have been read, the document is passed on to the Indexer. Youcan configure a list of matchers for the Indexer. A matcher is a definition that optionally defines apage and/or line and reads either a fixed workspace or analyzes a regular expression. If there areno page or line limits, you can search all pages or lines.The definition of a matcher consists of the following parts:Indexer.Matcher<serial number>=<group name>Â¶<page>Â¶<line>Â¶<regular expression>Indexer.Matcher<serial number>=<group name>Â¶<page>Â¶<line>Â¶<starting column>Â¶<length>Indexer.Matcher<serial number>=<group name>Â¶<composition>The group name is the ELO group from the metadata form definition.Pages and lines start at 1. If you want to search all pages or lines, you can enter an asterisk * as aplaceholder here.The regular expression can be any RegEx allowed in Java. However, it may only contain onereading area, marked by parentheses. The example RENRÂ¶1Â¶*Â¶INVOICE NO...:[]{1,5}([0-9]+)defines an expression beginning with INVOICE NO.â€¦:. This is followed by 1 to 5 spaces and finishedoff by a series of numbers (no length restriction). As only the last section is in parentheses, onlythis part with the numbers is added to the metadata. The rest is simply for identification.A matcher can compile its contents from other matchers. This compilation consists of fixed texts orthe content</s> 
<s>of other index fields. An index field is integrated by entering the group name in curlybrackets. This matcher does not have any side or line information.With position-dependent indexing, the regular expression is replaced with a starting column andthe length. In this case, precisely this area of the line is read. But before saving, leading or trailingspaces are removed via trim(). With this variant, a page and a line also have to be entered;searching across areas is not practical here.As there are comprehensive standard functions available, normally you will not have to create yourown Indexer. All you have to do is integrate the SimpleMatchIndexer:Indexer=com.elo.cold.processors.SimpleMatchIndexer7 ELO COLDDuplicate check Optionally, the indexer can be assigned a unique key. This is a normal index field whose contentscan be compiled from the previously read index fields and fixed text components (as with the shortname and filing location).Indexer.Key=RENRÂ¶RE:{INT.RENR}The structure Indexer.Key=<group name>Â¶<text or {<group name>} allows you to use all captureddata that can be used to form a unique key. The structure is the same as with the compiledmatchers.The unique key is only checked when the COLD data stream is read from RetryDir. In case of anerror, a COLD file can be submitted for filing again. All documents that have already been filed areignored in this repeat run. Only documents the unique key isn't found for are saved.PDF rendering As soon as the Indexserver is done, the document is forwarded to the Renderer in the pipeline. Thestandard Renderer should cover most cases. It is entered to the configuration as follows:Renderer=com.elo.cold.processors.RendererBaseThe Renderer requires information on the page size, character set used, line height, and margins.This data is provided in the configuration.In the COLD environment, lines may often be overprinted multiple times e.g.Â to create anunderscore. Carriage returns (\r) are inserted into a line without line feed (\n). This function issupported by the standard Renderer. More complexÂ functions, such as compound letters ( / + O = Ã˜) have to be created using a custom implementation. As this identification requires a great deal ofwork, this loss of time only makes sense if it is actually necessary.Background images After rendering text information, background texts or images can also be integrated. These areconfigured in the COLD channel folder as child folders (for texts) and documents (for pictures).In the simplest case, you just want to show a text at a specific position. The text, position, textcolor, and text size are entered to the extra text of the child folder.8 ELO COLDThe position consists of three parts: the page, the left margin, and the height. You can also enter *as the page; in this case, the text is output on every page. As the coordinates of PDF documents gofrom bottom to top, it would be inconvenient to show a text at the top edge of the document â€“ youwould have to know the page size. However, you can enter a negative value for the height, whichis then interpreted as the margin from the top edge.You can also set the angle of rotation and</s> 
<s>opacity. The angle is entered in degrees. 0 degrees is thenormal text orientation, 90 degrees is 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Opacity is specified inpercent. 0 is fully transparent, 100 is fully opaque.You can enter a B (for bold) ahead of the font size.Image backgrounds only have a position and an opacity setting. Please note that additional imagecomponents significantly increase the size of the generated PDF file. Even a small image can easilytake up ten times as much space as the entire document text. You should only use this featuresparingly.Filing to the repository The final step is filing to the repository. A standard Archiver is available that should cover mostcases.Archiver=com.elo.cold.processors.ArchiverBaseThe Archiver identifies the repository target, the short name, and the metadata form and uses thisinformation to create a metadata object for the ELO Indexserver. The PDF file is then created andsaved with the document.Message=ELO Digital Office GmbHPosition=1Â¶20Â¶-25FontSize=20Color=41040Message=Invoice copyPosition=1Â¶150Â¶200FontSize=B80Color=16744448Rotation=60Opacity=25Position=1Â¶20Â¶600Opacity=109 ELO COLDThe filing target can consist of fixed texts and placeholders, which in turn can consist of hits fromthe index matcher list. These placeholders are replaced with the group names. The structure is thesame as with the unique key or the compiled index fields.Archiver.Root=/COLD/{DESTINATION}/2017.01The same applies for the short name. It can also consist of fixed and dynamic text.Archiver.Subject=Invoice: {RENR}10 ELO COLDCustom enhancements Custom analysis modules can easily be created and integrated into the system.

The CRDs must be installed before the operator can be deployed. Installing the CRDs withthe Helm chart can be done by setting the value operator.crds.install to true in the values file.The default value is false.Or by using the --set flag with helm install or helm upgrade.This method installs the CRDs using a Job and ServiceAccount, which are deleted after the CRDs areinstalled. This job will also create the latest versions of the Custom Resource for the operator.This is the recommended way to install the CRDs.In addition to this method the CRDs can be downloaded and installed manually.

It helps you to understand the ELO system as a whole.The four most fundamental components of the Apache Tomcat server engine are the ELOIndexserver, ELO Access Manager, ELO Document Manager, and ELO iSearch module.Microserver architecture The server components are programmed in Java, which offers a high level of portability.The microserver architecture makes the system highly scalable.Servlet implementation permits easy integration with existing systems.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationArchitecture Authentication The ELO Access Manager is responsible for the central administration of the user list, the userscurrently logged on, the user rights and permissions, and the key lists. Each client and each serverprocess authenticates to the ELO Access Manager at startup. The ELO Access Manager creates aticket to identify the client and communicate with the ELO server processes.4 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationDocument storage A separate ELO Document Manager is required for each repository. The ELO Document Managersaves, manages, and delivers each document on request. When using Microsoft SQL Server, aseparate database is created for each repository. When using Oracle, an independent user with thesame name as the repository is created for each separate repository.The backup service and the EMC Centera interface are also run by the ELO Document Manager,provided that these additional modules have been purchased.5 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationScalability The ELOenterprise services are scalable. Nearly all of the services can be installed on a singlecomputer or they can each be installed on dedicated individual computers.6 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe different services can be installed to custom locations and, with a few exceptions that aredescribed in the respective chapters, any combination of the services can be installed on differentcomputers as required and depending upon the actual system requirements.7 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationELO server modules This chapter contains basic information regarding the ELO server modules. Refer to the separatedocumentation for more information. You will find the relevant links in the following sections.ELO Access Manager (ELOam) This section contains information about the ELO Access Manager (ELOam).The ELO Access Manager is an ELO Indexserver plug-in (ELOix). There is no separate WAR file forELOam.

Inaddition, the ELO Indexserver provides iSearch functionality to all ELO clients.Any number of ELO Indexservers may be installed for any number of repositories. You will findmore information under ELO server > Optimization > ELO Indexserver load balancing.Client applications can connect to the ELO Indexserver either via HTTP or HTTPS via SOAP or aproprietary Indexserver interface.For more information, refer to the ELO Indexserver, ELO Indexserver programming guide, and ELOIndexserver script development documentation.ELO Automation Services (ELOas) ELO Automation Services are used to automate tasks within a repository. ELOas works byprocessing any number of rulesets. Rulesets are XML-based instructions for a specific type of actionthat are stored within the Administration folder of the repository. You can install any number ofELOas instances for each repository. The process is described in this chapter.There are two types of rulesets: interval-controlled rulesets and direct rulesets.Interval-controlled rulesets are executed automatically in time intervals defined in the ruleset.They do not require user interaction.InformationThese intervals refer to the time between ruleset starts. If you create a ruleset that takes along time to complete, and the interval between ruleset executions is short, this may resultin the rule being executed multiple times at the same time.Common uses of ELOas include:Moving entries with certain metadata within the repositoryAutomatically performing functions in workflows, suchÂ as assigning usersNotifying users when specific criteria in the repository are metVarious backup and maintenance tasksFor more information, refer to the ELO Automation Services documentation.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 9 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationELO Web Forms Services (ELOwf) ELO Web Forms Services is a web application that handles several tasks, including:ELO workflow form componentsELO apps framework as the basis for: ELO Business Solutions appsELO Integration ClientELO Workflow ClientELO Teamroom ClientRunning ELO apps such as: ELO Forms 2.0ELO WorkspacesELO TeamspacesELO Flows activity UIRefer to the respective documentation for more information on each of these topics.Run multiple ELOwf instances ELOwf allows you to run multiple instances.

The functions aresimilar in other clients.ELO Textreader (ELOtr) ELO Textreader extracts text from documents and saves it in text files. After conversion, thedocument contents are available to the ELO iSearch module for indexing.Please noteStarting with ELO 21.4, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr).For more information, refer to the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) documentation.ELO OCR One of the most important aspects of the ELO system is the large range of search functions. Theserver-side processes supporting these functions consist of the OCR module, ELO Textreader, andELO iSearch.ELO OCR is an optional module which can be used with the ELO ECM Suite. It is installedautomatically with other ELO server modules.The ELO OCR Service converts documents into a machine-readable format. This section goes intodetail on this function.The OCR module runs as a server-based process on the repository server. The stored documentsare automatically indexed at regular intervals for the ELO iSearch database. Since the process runson the server, it does not affect the performance of the client applications. Each word within adocument is assigned an index value. The index values are structured in such a way to optimizesearch times for each term.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 11 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationPlease noteStarting with ELO 21.4, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr).For more information, refer to the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) documentation.ELO iSearch An ELO iSearch environment is made up of nodes and shards.Nodes are the individual instances of the iSearch service. Each repository has one node by default.Multiple nodes may be installed to improve search availability and performance. All iSearch nodesare usually combined within the same cluster.Shards are the atomic parts of the iSearch index. There is one shard per repository by default.Increasing the number of shards across different iSearch nodes should improve indexingperformance.For more information, refer to the ELO iSearch documentation.ELO XML Importer (ELOim) The ELO XML Importer is an ELO application used to import documents automatically into an ELOrepository based on an XML control file. The ELO XML</s>

For more information on using the ELO Web Client, see the corresponding documentation.Please noteA separate license is required to use the full ELO Web Client functionality. If you install theELO Web Client without purchasing a license, access will be restricted to devices running ELO for Mobile Devices.For more information, refer to the ELO Web Client and ELO Web Client administrationdocumentation.12 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationFull vs. FMD Web Client The ELO Web Client provides two different versions: the web client and the web client for mobiledevices.If you have purchased a license for the ELO Web Client, you can log on to the ELO repository viaany Internet browser. You may also access the ELO repository via the ELO for Mobile Devices appsfor Android and iOS.If you have not purchased a license for the ELO Web Client, it will install as an FMD version. Thismeans that you can log on to the ELO repository via the ELO for Mobile Devices apps, but not via abrowser.If you install the ELO Web Client and later decide to purchase a full license, you do not need toreinstall the ELO Web Client server application. Instead, change the ELO server license in the ELOServer Setup program or in the amoptions table in the ELO Access Manager. Restart the ELO serverafter changing the license number.Status page The default URL to the ELO Web Client is:http://<server name>:<port>/web-<repository name>Add /status to the end of the URL to go to the ELO Web Client status page: To see the completestatus page, select More information.

Inaddition, you can monitor specific threshold values, and set up an automatic e-mail notification ifthe values exceed the limits.If you want to use the ELO Health Check Service (in the following: HCS), you must make sure thatyou enter the corresponding URL in the Indexserver Configuration Options configuration interfaceand that the ELO Indexserver is allowed to send data to this URL. The data for the previous day issent in the early morning hours of the following day on a daily basis.In the Indexserver Configuration Options configuration interface, use an uploadHealthCheckurl typeentry with the following URL:If no URL is entered or the URL to the first version of the ELO Health Check Service is entered, theURL specified above is entered in the database/the old value is replaced with this correct URL.Enter NONE to disable transmission of the URL data.You have to send a request to the ELO Order Center to enable ELO HCS. You can submit this requestto the ELO Order Center by e-mail.A technical contact person for the partner and the customer were specified when you placed theorder. These e-mail addresses are used by all automated processes. Ideally, you should use aseparate technical e-mail account for this.Health Check data is only sent from Indexserver versions ELO 20 or higher. Older ELO Indexserversare unable to provide this service.Starting with ELO 12, the installer distinguishes between production and test instances. When usingthe HCS, it is necessary to separate them in any case to ensure that test data is not mixed up withproduction data, which can lead to unreliable data visualizations.Since the ELO HCS Dashboard shows data from the past, we recommend that you first install it andconfigure the dashboard itself a few days later. This will enable you to see data about the currentinstallation during the configuration.https://license.elo.com/HealthCheckService2/Main/data/guid3 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationInitial logon To authenticate, open the following URL:When you log on for the first time, you won't have a password as this would need to have beensent by e-mail, which is not secure.Click Password forgotten.In the next dialog box, you need to enter your e-mail address and the GUID from the serialnumber. You can read this GUID from the license file, forÂ example:https://license.elo.com/HealthCheckService2/index.html4 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationInformationThe GUID is only the combination of characters inside the brackets.

This linktakes you to the new password and can only be used once.Open the link.When you click the link, the HCS generates a new password and displays it over anencrypted HTTPS connection. The password is therefore not transmitted via an insecurechannel, such asÂ e-mail.5 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationMake a note of this password. We recommend saving it in your browser so that you do nothave to enter it each time.

You can also arrange the charts differently later on using drag-and-drop.If you click the Settings button, you can change the settings of the chart.8 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationName: You can change the name of the chart here. This can be useful if you have multipleELO Indexservers or want to view the same chart type with different settings, forÂ example.Hourly/Daily/Weekly: You can use this setting to change the visualization of data changesover time. If you want to observe a trend over longer periods of time, it is useful to visualizethe data averaged over weeks. If you want a more detailed overview of the current situation,it makes sense to create an hourly view, e.g. whenÂ most users log on during the course of aday. In many other cases, the daily overview is the most practical option.Day selection: If you want to restrict the daily or hourly overview to certain days of the week,you can do so with this option.Indexserver: If you have installed multiple ELO Indexservers, you can specify which ELOIndexserver should be displayed here.

We recommend that youspecify a range from a few days or weeks in the past to the current date. The time ranges areentered in days. The default setting covers the last three months. To be exact, "93 days agountil now", i.e. 93...0.Scale: With the Minimum â€“ Average â€“ Maximum charts, there may be maximum values whichare so high that the average values are only displayed as a flat line at the bottom of thechart.This parameter allows you to specify a divider factor for each line. If the average search timeis 50 milliseconds, but there are searches that take up to one minute, you can set MAXdivider to 1000.10 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThese settings allow you to monitor large outliers in a chart simultaneously, as well as thegeneral (much smaller) average value.11 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationIf you want to see both the long-term trend and the current situation for a specific parameterin a more granular view, you can create multiple charts for this parameter. The first chartcould be a weekly overview of 180 days, and a second chart could be a daily overview of thelast three days.12 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationSet up monitors To set up monitors, click the configuration icon in the upper right corner to switch to the ELO HealthCheck Service Configuration. In this menu, you can set up monitors for each recorded parameter.The HCS distinguishes between two types of parameters. There are counters, suchÂ as for thenumber of logons or number of garbage collections, and Min/Max/Avr, which display average valuesas well as minimum and maximum values, suchÂ as the required memory or the number of activeusers.Under Counter Properties, you can monitor absolute threshold values, suchÂ as for failed logonattempts. If there are more than ten failed attempts in an hour, this indicates a brute force attackon passwords.You can also specify threshold values as a percentage. These relate to the average over the lastthree months, e.g. if the number of garbage collections increases by more than 50%, this indicatesthat the ELO Indexserver does not have enough heap space.As the values can fluctuate considerably on different days of the week, the specified percentagelimits are only compared with the average on the same day of the week to prevent false alerts.13 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe Min/Max/Avr properties have the same settings, although three are shown here for each chart.It makes sense to monitor the average values to detect gradual changes. Checking the maximumvalues</s> 
<s>is better suited to detect acute problems.14 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationInformation for partners If you specified a partner's e-mail address when you placed the order, this serial number is linkedto the partner's account. As a partner, you can access the page https://license.elo.com/HealthCheckService2/alerts.html to obtain an overview of the current state of all customers.If there are no alerts for a customer, the icon to the left of the customer name is green. If no HCSdata has been sent in the last three days, the icon is red. If limits have been exceeded, the icon isyellow and the corresponding values are displayed.Clicking the colored icon takes you to the respective customer dashboard. There is currently nodistinction between a partner request and a customer request. This has the advantage that apartner can configure the customer dashboard and modify it at any time. However, this also meansthat there are no different views for customers and partners.If thresholds were set for a chart, the warning e-mail is sent to both the customer's e-mail addressand the partner's e-mail address.If customers do not want to manage their own HCS dashboard, this can also be done by the partner.In this case, you should create a separate e-mail account, e.g. ELO-HCS@mycompany.com. This is the15 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationaccount that you need to specify as the customer's account when you place the order. However,you do not need to create a separate account for each customer. You can still log on to thedashboard with this account, since the API token can be used to distinguish between the differentcustomers.16 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationData protection The ELO Health Check Service only records average values from an entire server every hour. Nopersonal data is collected or transmitted in the process, and it is not possible to draw conclusionsabout individual users from the data.However, you should still keep the password and API token safe, since the HCS contains data thatcould be sensitive in certain contexts (e.g. the number of logons allows conclusions to be drawnabout the number of employees). An attacker requires both the serial number GUID and the APItoken to gain unauthorized access. As this is generated automatically, a new one can be issuedimmediately if there is any cause for concern.17 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationMonitoringIntroduction ELO offers different starting points for monitoring the system status.

It can help improve performance if you organize the fieldvalues in a metadata table. Unlike the "objkeys" table, the field values are stored in the columns ofthe database table instead of in the rows.InformationThis documentation applies to ELO 10 and higher.This document describes how to improve searching multiple metadata fields by organizing the fieldvalues as a metadata table.This documentation:Describes the problemPresents the solutionExplains the implementationDescribes the effects on other ELO modulesExplains the restrictionsâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationProblem It can take a long time to search multiple index fields in the Objkeys table if the SQL Optimizerdoes not recognize the strict search criteria in the query.In our use case, we perform searches using the bank code, account number, and a time range. The objkeys table contains 370 million rows. The search takes 1-3 seconds if the SQL Server has 48Â GBRAM. It takes 50 seconds if the server has 16Â GB RAM. In Oracle Enterprise Manager, we can seethat the priority ranking of the search is the bank code followed by the time range and finally theaccount number. This means that the Optimizer does not recognize that the search should first findthe account number, which is unique.4 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationSolution Instead of one row per index value and multiple rows per document when storing the field values tothe objkeys table, the field values are stored in a "flat" table with one column per field value andone row per document. Performance tests based on the e-mail data in our live repository haveshown a five-fold increase in speed.5 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationImplementation New metadata form property: Data organization The metadata form uses the DocMask.dataOrganisation field to determine how field values shouldbe stored:Data organization DB storageDATA_ORGANISATION_OBJKEYS =Conventional storage as name-value pairs in the objkeys tableDATA_ORGANISATION_TABLE = 1;Metadata table, one table for the metadata form (flat table), onecolumn per field.Converting existing field data You can convert the field values of an existing metadata form into a metadata table using thefollowing code.The index values are converted by setting the elementdataOrganisation = DocMaskC.DATA_ORGANISATION_TABLEand then checking in the metadata form.In a background job, the ELO Indexserver moves the data from the objkeys table to the metadatatable. The job status is listed under the GUID of the metadata form. It can be retrieved with queryJobState.InformationIt is not possible to convert fields with invalid group names, nor is it possible toconvert fields with duplicate group names.Currently, it is not possible to convert a metadata table back into an objkeys table.For fields with multiple field values (column index), only the first value</s> 
<s>is transferredto the metadata table.During the update, no changes should be made to the folder or document metadatathat are assigned metadata with the metadata form. However, you can create newdocuments and folders.The original file name is stored in the objkeys table (ELO_FNAME).On startup, the Indexserver checks whether a conversion process was interrupted. Ifthis is the case, the Indexserver continues the conversion by evaluating an entry inthe eloixopt table with6 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationExample Representation in the database The metadata table is created under the name "Keywording_" plus the metadata form ID.

This is the soleresponsibility of the database administrator.Case-insensitive search with Oracle To perform a case-insensitive search with Oracle, function-based indexes have to be used. Textcolumns in the index are added as an UPPER function argument.A suitable index could look as follows:Editing the metadata form definition When you add a field in the ELO Administration Console, a column is added to the metadata table.Please noteThis column contains NULL values. Setting a default value for a field would take a very longtime for large tables. Existing objects are not assigned default values for this reason. Theyonly apply for new folders and documents.Inversely, when you delete a field, the Indexserver removes the corresponding column fromthe table.All field data is lost. [liefernr] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [bestellnr] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [betreff] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [kdnr] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [lieferant] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [barcode] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [betrag] [nvarchar](255) NULL, [mitarb] [nvarchar](CREATE INDEX "ARCHIV1"."IXKEYWORDING_32_01" ON "ARCHIV1"."KEYWORDING_32" UPPER(BANK), UPPER(KTO), PARENTIDTABLESPACE "TS_ELO_INDEX";8 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationInformationLike the metadata forms with objkeys data, metadata forms with metadata tables can onlybe deleted if no more objects have this metadata.When deleting a metadata form, if you specify an alternative one, the data is not convertedautomatically.MEtadata forms are not deleted permanently.Searching metadata tables with "findfirstSords" The table to be searched is defined based on the metadata form specified in FindByIndex.If no metadata form is specified in the search, the metadata forms are determined using thefield group names from the search query.A search is run on the metadata tables that contain all the field groups specified in FindByIndex.objKeys.If a metadata form with objkeys-based data contains all of the fields, the search is alsoperformed on the objkeys table.If no metadata form contains all of the fields in the search, only objkeys is searched.If metadata forms are specified in the FindByIndex, only these forms are searched.

The zeros are taken into account (example3).Example 1:The name of your backup path is backup1.Now create an additional path titled backup2; which should point to another drive or another server.This would be followed by backup3 etc.Example 2:The name of your backup path is xyz.The next path is xyz2, followed by xyz3, etc.Example 3:The name of your backup path is b001.The next path is b002, followed by b003, etc.After b009 comes b010.Path rerouting occurs when a path can no longer be written to. To force or to test path rerouting, allyou have to do is change the rights to the relevant backup directory and its sub-directories suchthat the ELO Document Manager can no longer write to it. A corresponding message will thenappear in the ELO Document Manager log file, and the next path will be used if possible.If the path can no longer be written to, but no follow-up path is available, an error message willappear on the status page of the ELO Document Manager (in the browser), as well as in the log file.The backup program will pause for a period and then attempt a backup again.In this case, create one or more follow-up paths.Backup slots One path number and backup slot are specified in each backup profile. This means that a documentcan be backed up to up to four paths, for example on various devices.19 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationExamplesA backup profile called "Test profile" exists. Path number 2 and backup slot 1 are specified for thisprofile. This means that all documents are backed up on path 2. This path number 2 is entered inbackup slot 1.There are two backup profiles:a) "Test profile1" with path number 2 and backup slot 1b) "Test profile2" with path number 3 and backup slot 2This means that all documents on path 2 and path 3 are backed up and are entered to slots 1 and 2.If you use multiple backup profiles and you want to back up all documents for each profile, youshould try to make sure that the profiles are clearly distinguished from one another. Each profileshould use a different backup slot and path number, so that each slot and</s> 
<s>each path number occursonly once.If you only want to back up certain documents, other settings are more helpful (see section Onlyback up certain documents).When backup documents are no longer in the repository, meaning that they need to be recoveredfor access, the first occupied slot with the lowest slot number is always used. The fastest backupmedium should therefore ideally be specified in the profile with the lowest slot number used.In the elodmdocs database table, backup slot 1 corresponds to pathid2, slot 2 to pathid3, and so on.Only back up certain documents (SQL Select) To only back up certain documents, such as those with a certain file extension, you must enter acorresponding SQL command to the SQL select field when creating a backup profile.If you don't enter anything, predefined SQL commands are used. In ELO Document Managerversions before 7.00.040, no backup could be created from another backup slot - only from theoriginal. The document IDs of the documents set for backup have been collected with the simpleSQL commands in the following table:BackupslotSimple SQL command (onlybackup from original)Advanced SQL command (backup from backupslot also possible)1 (pathid2)select docid from elodmdocswhere pathid>0 and pathid2=0select docid from elodmdocs where pathid2=0 and(pathid>0 or pathid3>0 or pathid4>0 or pathid5>0)2(pathid3)select docid from elodmdocswhere pathid>0 and pathid3=0select docid from elodmdocs where pathid3=0 and(pathid>0 or pathid2>0 or pathid4>0 or pathid5>0)3(pathid4)select docid from elodmdocswhere pathid>0 and pathid4=0select docid from elodmdocs where pathid4=0 and(pathid>0 or pathid2>0 or pathid3>0 or pathid5>0)4(pathid5)select docid from elodmdocswhere pathid>0 and pathid5=0select docid from elodmdocs where pathid5=0 and(pathid>0 or pathid2>0 or pathid3>0 or pathid4>0)20 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationHere, pathid is the path ID of the filing path. Pathid2 to pathid5 are the path IDs for the backup area,corresponding to backup slots 1 to 4.A value of 0 means that no path ID has been entered, meaning there is no backup for that slot.In the database table elodmdocs, a backup profile writing to backup slot 1 (i.e. pathid2) andentering path number 2 looks like this:Recommendations for SQL command structure ELO Document Manager 7.00.040 and higher uses the advanced SQL commands in the table aboveby default to enable backup of another backup slot. You can use the corresponding SQL commandfrom the table above. However, it should always contain the following:select docid from elodmdocsOnly then will the document IDs be returned.Additionally, a condition should be specified that states a path ID is entered somewhere else (in thefiling path or in another backup slot), which means a document exists that can be copied. Forexample:where pathid>0It is also useful to define a condition that states the path ID is still 0 from the backup slot in use(pathid2, pathid3, pathid4 or pathid5). For example:pathid2=0This condition ensures documents are only backed up once.A simple example for specific documents in backup slot 1:select docid from elodmdocs where pathid>0 and pathid2=0 and docid>1000Please noteELO Document Manager does not check whether the SQL command is correct or rational.Therefore, please check whether the SQL commands are executed correctly. Look at the ELODocument Manager log file and in the</s> 
<s>elodmdocs database table.Using ELO Replication This section addresses backup used in combination with the ELO Replication module.21 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationIf the ELO Replication module is in use and DDS transfer is enabled for replication, a commandmust always be entered to the profile under SQL Select ensuring that DDS replacements that areonly temporarily valid will not be backed up.When DDS files are transferred, ELO Replication creates small temporary files with the extension TXT before the original document is written. However, ELO Document Manager should not createbackups of these temporary documents, as otherwise the original documents to be transferred at alater time by ELO Replication would no longer be backed up. If old documents are removed withoutbackup control, only the backed up temporary file would still exist.These temporary files always have the MD5 hash of 90F7168D4A2F4846E5846A75092F7C83 andthe same contents ("DDS temporary replacement").To prevent backup of these files, the entry for backup slot 1 would be as follows:select docid from elodmdocs where pathid\>0 and pathid2=0 and md5 !='90F7168D4A2F4846E5846A75092F7C83'In addition, the creation of MD5 hashes when creating documents must be enabled in ELODocument Manager. This is normally the case, and can only be disabled manually. Otherwise, the md5 column in the elodmdocs table would not be filled, which would make a query to the databaseimpossible.EMC Centera Procedure If you wish to use an EMC Centera for your backup, you must do the following before creating abackup profile:You require a Centera SDK from EMC that corresponds to the Document Manager (seefollowing section Centera SDK and CentraStar versions). If you use Windows, Linux, orSolaris, you can find the SDK on the ELO DVD (for Windows, both 32-bit and 64-bit versionsare available; otherwise a version for both 32-bit and 64-bit can be used).Close the ELO client and stop the Apache Tomcat server/the ELO Application Server.Remove the files for an old Centera SDK if any exist.Install the SDK files as described in the Installation chapter of the instructions (PDF file) fromEMC. In Linux and Solaris environments, a script must also be run. In Windows, extract theSDK to a temporary folder and copy (for SDK 3.2 p5) all 8 DLL files from the lib32 or lib64directory into the Apache Tomcat/ELO Application Server directory bin (i.e. not the file withthe extension LIB). Alternatively, you can use a different directory where the operatingsystem can find the files.Copy the FPLibrary.jar file from the SDK to the Apache Tomcat/ELO Application Serversubdirectory shared\lib. If the file already exists from an older Centera SDK, replace it.22 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationLinux and Solaris: Check the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This must be set in theprofile for the account used to run Apache Tomcat.Example (for Linux running a 64-bit version of Java):LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Centera_SDK/lib/64Java may not find the libraries, resulting in an UnsatisfiedLinkError upon the first Centera access.You must then additionally specify java.library.path for Apache Tomcat in the CATALINA_OPTSenvironment variable. For example:CATALINA_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/Centera\_SDK/lib/64"The variable can be defined in your script that calls the Tomcat start script, for example. TheELOenterprise DVD contains a small Java program from</s> 
<s>ELO in the Centera SDK directory that letsyou quickly test Java access to the Centera libraries.In the corresponding ELO Document Manager, enable the use of the Centera library. Do sowith the following SQL command:update elodmopt set optval='true' where optno=105Specify a temporary directory for ELO Document Manager (to which Apache Tomcat has writeaccess) with an SQL command. If your directory is c:\temp:update elodmopt set optval= 'c:\temp' where optno=107Check whether the preset of 600 seconds for retention in ELO Document Manager should bechanged. The length of the deletion lock when writing documents on the Centera can bedefined in three locations:a) In the ELO Administration Console backup profileb) In the elodmopt database table (optno=12)c) In Centera itselfWithin these three, a) has the highest priority, b) the second highest, and c) the third-highest. If avalue greater than 0 is entered to the backup profile, this number will be used. If 0 is entered to thebackup profile, the value will be used that is defined in the elodmopt table. If 0 is entered to the elodmopt table as well, the Centera preset will be used.Start Apache Tomcat.You now have to create an additional path entry in the ELO client.In the Access path field, enter the IP address or the server name of the Centera, optionallyfollowed by the port, separated by a colon (the default is port 3218).Examples :`100.100.100.1â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ 23 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationCentera test: 3218'You may specify multiple Centeras by separating each with a semicolon.Example:100.100.100.1:3218;100.100.100.2You can also specify PEA files (see section Centera profile and PEA file).Select the Centera path option in the Structure field. Also select the option Use as backuppath.An example:Please noteCentera can only be used for backup paths. It can only be used for backup slot 1.24 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationOlder version of Centera SDK InformationIf ELO was already using an older version of Centera SDK: The Centera log file you couldpreviously enter in the elodmopt table for logging reasons in older versions is no longercreated starting with SDK 3.1p1. Use the following SQL command to see whether you havespecified such a file:select \* from elodmopt where optno=106 If this is the case, remove this file specificationwith the following: update elodmopt set optval= '' where optno=106Centera SDK and CentraStar versions If possible, use the version of the Centera SDK on the ELO DVD. The following table shows whichalternative versions may be used.In our experience, the version of CentraStar (which is the version of Centera itself) can also behigher, so for example an ELOdm and Centera SDK 3.2 will work alongside CentraStar 4.0.ELO DocumentManagerCentera SDKusedOther tested CenteraSDKsTestedCentraStarFrom 4.0 2.3 3.1 p1 3.1From 5.00.020 3.1 p1 3.2 3.1, 4.0From 6.00.080 3.2 3.1 p1 4.0From 8.00.012 3.2 p5 3.2 4.2Please noteWhen using combinations that have not yet been tested (of ELO Document Manager, SDK,and CentraStar), you should perform tests before production use (backup, deletion of olddocuments, and restoration of documents).Centera profile and PEA file If your Centera uses a Centera profile, which requires the use of a PEA file</s> 
<s>for access, there are twopossibilities.In the document path You can specify a PEA file when entering the document path.Example:100.120.140.1?D:\Centera\profil.pea25 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationYou may specify multiple Centeras by separating each with a semicolon.100.120.140.1?D:\Centera\profil.pea;100.120.140.2?D:\Centera\profil2.peaAs environment variable Create an environment variable named CENTERA_PEA_LOCATION that is recognized by the accountunder which Apache Tomcat/the ELO Application Server runs. If this runs on the system account inWindows, it must be a system variable. Enter the path and the name of the PEA file as the variable.For example:d:\test\profil1.peaIf it is a system variable in Windows, you will have to restart your system, as otherwise theenvironment variable will not be activated.The PEA file must not contain any deletion rights.Possible error messages when using a Centera profile The error message "The use of this operation is restricted" means that a PEA file must bespecified to access the Centera and no PEA file has been found.The error message "Failed to authenticate PEA data" can result in cases where the PEA filehas not been found. In this latter case, check whether the PEA file is actually located in thecorrect location.Other error messages java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/filepool/fplibrary/FPPool This message occurs in cases where the Centera Java file FPLibrary.jar has not beenfound. It must be placed in the Tomcat directory shared\lib. The directory must also bedefined in the Tomcat file catalina.properties, which, however, automatically occursduring server setup.java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.filepool.natives.FPLibraryNative.setLastError(I)V This message occurs if the Centera libraries were not found.NetApp storage system The NetApp system can be used in ELO either as a standard filing path or as a path for backups.Please noteWhen using the NetApp system, Apache Tomcat/the ELO Application Server cannot run onthe system account. You must use an account that is able to access the other server. Thisaccount must have full access to the Tomcat/ELO Application Server directory, as well as tothe configuration and data directories of the individual web applications. We recommendchanging the owner of these directories and files accordingly.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â€¢ â—¦ 26 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationWith SnapLock If you also want to use the SnapLock function, the hardware ensures that files can only be deletedafter a period of time that you specify.If you use the SnapLock functionality when backing up the ELO Document Manager, you have twoways of specifying the period in which a document is protected:Use the Default retention period for the NetApp systemSet the retention period when filing to the ELO client. If the document is saved by the backupprogram in the ELO Document Manager, the latter date will be used. If this date falls outsidean interval defined on the NetApp volume, it will be automatically modified by the NetAppsystem.InformationWhen using SnapLock, enable the WORM path option in ELO when creating the documentpath.NetApp system as default filing path Please noteYou should also enable the WORM path option when using it as the default filing path.However, this means the document status of Version control disabled (previously Freelyeditable) can no longer be used. Additionally, it is no longer possible to move paths andremove old</s> 
<s>documents. If the WORM path option is not enabled (not recommended), errorsmay occur when removing old documents. Conflicts may arise between the default settingsfor storage (default retention period) and the NetApp limit date. It is possible that databaseentries are changed, but the corresponding documents will not be able to be deleted.Backup function test with SnapLock Create a backup path on the Network Appliance server.Create the backup path in the ELO Administration Console. Enable the WORM path option.Create a corresponding backup profile.On the ELO Document Manager status page, check whether backup is running. If not, start itin the ELO Administration Console.File a document in the ELO client.Attempt to delete the backed up file in the file system. This should not be possible ifSnapLock is working.27 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationUsing retention periods in the ELO client If you want to set a retention period (in older versions: expiration date) in the ELO client, you mustmake some changes in the ELO Document Manager. The ELO Document Manager must be set to logthe last access date for a document after the document has been backed up.InformationThe retention period is only set for the backup, not when using the NetApp system as thedefault filing path. You can specify NetApp date entries up to January 17, 2071 for theretention period. The ELO Document Manager automatically corrects later retention periodsby setting them to the last possible date.ProcedureIn the database, enable the option to set the last access date on the backup(USE_BACKUP_LAST_ACCESS). Also, in the elodmopt database table, change the value forrecord 108 to true for the affected repository. You can use the following SQL command:update elodmopt set optval='true' where optno=108If the record does not yet exist, create it. Use the following SQL command to do so:insert into elodmopt values (108,'true','USE\_BACKUP\_LAST\_ACCESS')Restart Apache Tomcat.Now the ELO Document Manager sets the last access date for documents on the backup. However,this is only the case if a document retention period has been set in the ELO client.Function test Create a backup path on the NetApp server.Create the document path.

If you want to run more than one TSM session per ELODocument Manager, a storage pool with random access should be used (unit class: DISK). Ifsubsequent media are defined, they must be of the same type, i.e. not with sequentialaccess. Otherwise, simultaneous accesses would block each other until the end of theaffected TSM session.

The TSM server is only accessedwhen documents are backed up or restored.Check</s> 
<s>whether the backup service is running (see section Check).Document backup to the TSM server should work without putting out error messages. If aconnection to the TSM server cannot be established, another attempt will be made later.Test whether documents can be restored (not recommended for productive repositories!).Also test the purge documents feature. Use the current date as the expiration date. Thebacked up documents will first be deleted from the hard drive. After restarting the ELO client,the old documents should be restored from the TSM server when you attempt to accessthem.Other notes Please also note the following.Filing structure of documents on the TSM server If you intend to use more than one ELO Document Manager with a TSM connection, you shouldknow the filing structure, in order to avoid writing in the same data range. If they write data in thesame range, although no documents will be lost, various documents with various TSM object IDswill be created. This means it will be unclear which documents will be retrieved after a query.Incidentally, this can also occur if the elodmdocs table is manipulated in such a way thatdocuments are stored a second time on the TSM.The following values are decisive for the filing structure:Client node nameThe ELO Document Manager will log on to the TSM as a client node.

The ELO Document Manager uses therepository name, followed by a special directory name.Example (repository name = EXTEN1): EXTEN1/upr00000If relative path entries are used, the high level name is placed after the relative path,separated from each other with a forward slash.Example : servername?abc would turn into: abc/EXTEN1/upr00000Low level nameThe low level name is comparable to the file name, e.g. 00000001.jpg.These three entries combine to form the following filing structure for the first document, when thefile space name, high level name, and low level name are written in sequence:/elofs1/EXTEN1/upr00000/00000001.jpgWith another ELO Document Manager, it looks like this (with the same file space name):/elofs1/EXTEN2/upr00000/00000001.jpgIf each ELO Document Manager has its own node name, there should be no problems.Alternatively (or in addition), you can also define a different file space name for each ELODocument Manager.A name of a repository always refers to a specific ELO Document Manager.Conclusion Care should be taken in the configuration if, in addition to a server with a production system, aserver with a test system with its own database is to be used, that however is to access the sameTSM.'Remove old documents' dialog box If the ELO Document Manager only establishes one session per TSM server, only one access to theTSM server can take place at one time.

However, the function can beextended correspondingly.Please noteThe expansion is not possible for paths with the WORM path option enabled.The expansion of the Delete permanently function occurs through the elodmopt database table.The value of the optno=20 record is decisive here. If it does not exist, you can create it with thefollowing SQL command:insert into elodmopt values (20,'0','DELETE_BACKUP_FILE_MODE (0=off, 1=file system, 2=externstorage devices, 3=all)')Please noteIf deletion protection is enabled, for example on Centera or NetApp, deletion will not bepossible. Use values of 1 or 2 as alternatives.optnooptval(default)remark Explanation20 0 DELETE_BACKUP_FILE_MODE 0 = do not delete backup files1 = only delete backup files on the file system2 = only delete backup files on external datastorage devices (such as Centera or Azure Blob)3 = delete backup filesInformationBackup documents that have been backed up using the Activator interface can only bedeleted if the newer Activator libraries (after 2009) are used.Restriction with MD5 paths With MD5 paths, only one original copy may exist for each file. If an identical file is usedsomewhere else, it is considered as a reference to the original file. Thus, when deleting documentsfrom MD5 paths, the ELO Document Manager must check whether a file is still in use somewhereelse. For each backup slot, a check will be performed to see if a file may be deleted.40 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationIf, however, the same MD5 path is used in multiple backup profiles, a file may occur in multiplebackup slots. In this case, deletion must be prevented from that path. There are a few ways toachieve this:Disable deletion of backup documents (a value of 0 for the optno 20 record).Only delete backup files on external storage devices like Centera or Azure Blob (a value of 2for the optno 20 record), but only if no MD5 path is used.Set the affected MD5 path as a WORM path. In that case, however, no temporary files will beused with the backup.Manual deletion ImportantNo files can be deleted manually on the file system or on external data storage devices,since these are still stored in the database.If a backup device fails completely or becomes unusable in such a way that the backed updocuments no longer exist on a backup slot, this must be applied to the database. To do so, thebackup service must be stopped and the path column must be set to 0 for the affected backup slotin the elodmdocs database table (slot 1 corresponds to the pathid2 column,</s> 
<s>slot 2 corresponds to pathid3, and so on).Sample SQL command for backup slot 1:update elodmdocs set pathid2=0Additionally, the backup profile in use should be deleted if the backup device is no longer available.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 41 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationPasswordsCreating encrypted and encoded passwords In the Create password area of the ELO Administration Console, you can create encrypted/encodedpasswords for ELO.Input: Enter the unencrypted password in the Input field.The encrypted/encoded passwords appear automatically in the Encrypted ELO password, EncryptedELOas database password, and Encoded Base64 password fields.42 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationClick the document icon to the right of the fields to copy the field contents to the Windowsclipboard.43 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationPreview documentsInformation Please noteStarting with ELO 21.4, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr).For more information, refer to the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) documentation.44 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationDocument redactionIntroduction This document describes how to configure the ELO Document Manager to use the redaction featurein ELO, which allows the user to redact parts of TIFF documents in the repository using a blackrectangle. This does not change the original document. The user can configure permissions to onlyallow specific users or groups to see the area underneath the black rectangle.The ELO Document Manager performs redaction on the original image file provided to the clientapplication. This means that it is not possible for users without the required permissions to view orcopy the text behind the redaction mark.Please noteBefore you can use the redaction tool, you need to make changes in SQL Server. For moreinformation about the entries in SQL, refer to the chapter Activation on the server. This isalso necessary if you can click the Redaction function in the viewer toolbar.45 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationRequirements ELOenterprise or ELOprofessional 6.00.080 or higher (server version).Apache Tomcat version 6.0.20 or higher.

JPEGcompression in TIFF files is not supported. Some older compression settings are alsounsupported. In this case, the image is not created.Server: Windows, Linux (Mac OS is not supported).WarningIf you use document redaction with file formats other than those listed here, redaction maynot work properly and text may still be visible.In addition, configuration errors can disable document redaction.Only use document redaction in controlled environments.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 46 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationActivation on the server To enable document redaction on the server, you need to change two settings in the ELO DocumentManager elodmopt table:Enable TIFF redaction:First, check whether the required data set exists:If the data set already exists:If it doesn't exist:Define a temporary directory that must already exist.

A package contains all theconfigurations required for a purpose.The following elements can be embedded in packages:Metadata formsAspectsFieldsFormsGroupsKeyword listsWorkspace typesTeamspace templatesFont colorsFlowsWorkflowsTranslationsScriptsIcons, etc.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 4 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationPackages can easily be transferred to other systems. A package export contains all configurationsfor the available elements. They can be read into other systems and used with little effort.The levels concept allows you to manage and update customizations separately from the defaultconfiguration.For more information, refer to the ELO packages documentation.Metadata model The model has been extended to map metadata. An additional structure level has been introducedbetween the metadata forms and fields: aspects.The metadata forms now have an additional data organization type: ASPECT. In this context, we alsorefer to aspect metadata forms.For more information, refer to the ELO packages documentation.Aspect forms In simplified terms, metadata forms are made up of aspects.The aspects contain the fields5 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationAspect metadata forms are visualized in the interface by forms. The metadata forms no longercontain any UI-relevant information (e.g. positions of the fields).The concept of field templates is redundant with aspect metadata forms.The fields are labeled aspect lines in the aspect itself. Like the metadata form, an aspect is anobject in the database with a unique name and ID.Previous metadata model The previous metadata model will be retained. The aspects and aspect metadata forms are inaddition to them and are supported in parallel.When creating a metadata form, the user chooses a data organization type for the metadata form.Later, there will not be an option to convert from/to aspect data organization.Aspects in metadata forms â€“ 'Aspect mappings' A metadata form can contain an aspect multiple times â€“ each time with a different name.This is referred to as aspect mapping.Example:6 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe Address aspect occurs twice in the Correspondence metadata form, as sender and as receiver. Sender and receiver are the aspect mappings under which the aspect occurs in the metadata form.Aspect mapping properties Aspect mappings are unique within the aspect metadata form via their name.Aspect mappings are listable, i.e. they are an aggregation of the same aspects.Each aspect mapping has a cardinality as a</s> 
<s>property:optionalmandatoryoptional manymandatory manyExample:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 7 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationFor the Invoice item aspect with the fields Article no., Name, Quantity, and Price, the Invoicemetadata form has a listable aspect mapping Invoice item with the cardinality mandatory many.An aspect mapping is mapped in the code by the new API class AspectAssoc.The cardinality is expressed by the new API class Cardinality.Inheritance relationships between metadata forms In aspect metadata forms, there can be inheritance relationships. Aspect metadata forms can"inherit" aspect mappings from other aspect metadata forms. Inheritance is additive only, i.e.inherited aspect mappings cannot be changed or overwritten in the child metadata form.As you can see in the image, a child metadata form can inherit from multiple parent metadataforms. No contradicting properties of the inherited aspect mappings and locally defined aspectmappings may occur. This should be avoided in the concept. When checking in a metadata form,the ELO Indexserver checks whether this results in inconsistent aspect mappings or cycles in theinheritance structure.The essential properties of the aspect mappings are:â€¢ 8 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe name of the aspect mapping as a unique characteristic within the metadata formThe ID of the aspect that the aspect mapping refers toThe cardinality of the aspect mappingThe access rights of the aspect mappingA metadata form can inherit a locally defined aspect mapping and an aspect mapping with thesame name from another metadata form. However, all of the properties above have to match. Theaspect allocation only occurs once in the result in the child metadata form.A parent metadata form inherits all its aspect mappings to its child metadata form(s), i.e. both theaspect mappings you defined locally and the aspect mappings it inherited itself from othermetadata forms.Aspect objects in the 'Sord' class After the structure of the metadata is defined via aspects and metadata forms, the concrete fieldvalues can be mapped in the aspect objects in the Sord class.The aspect objects of a SORD can be found in the aspects structure.The aspect objects of a SORD are organized as a map structure:The external map provides a list of aspect objects for a specific aspect mapping. A list as theaspect mappings have a cardinality and are listable (see section Aspect mapping properties).The internal map returns the index value for a field. The key in the map is the defined line key ofthe aspect line.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Map<String, List<Map<String, IndexValue>>> aspects9 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationExample in Java:InformationThe external map always returns a list of aspect objects, even if the cardinality of theaspect mapping is "many". The only entry is then at position 0 of the returned list.The aspect objects of a SORD are read/written when the member flag SordC.mbAspectObjects is set.Values of index fields: 'IndexValue' For SORDs created with an aspect metadata form, values of fields are shown using the class IndexValue. The IndexValue is a serializable container for the field value and has a type.The IndexValue is assigned a value depending on the aspect line type.The value is accessed depending on the type, e.g.</s> 
<s>with getIntValue() etc.An IndexValue is explicitly not arrayable or listable.Field types The type of a field is defined in the AspectLine class when defining an aspect. The later value of thefield in the IndexValue class has a corresponding type.The following aspect line types are currently supported:TextIntegerDoubleRelationISODate_ONLY (date without time)ISODate_TIME (date with time)StatusThe type constants are defined in the AspectLineC class and based on the previous class DocMaskLineC constants.The following corresponding types of the IndexValue class exist for the aspect line types:Aspect line type IndexValue type Access to the valueTYPE_TEXT TYPE_STRING getStringValue()TYPE_INTEGER TYPE_INT getIntValue()TYPE_DOUBLE TYPE_DOUBLE getDoubleValue()String zip = sord.getAspects();int quantity = sord.getAspects();â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 10 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationAspect line type IndexValue type Access to the valueTYPE_RELATION TYPE_RELATION getStringValue()TYPE_ISO_DATE_ONLY TYPE_ISO_DATE_ONLY getIsoDateOnlyValue()TYPE_ISO_DATE_TIME TYPE_ISO_DATE_TIME getIsoDateTimeValue()TYPE_STATUS TYPE_STATUS getStringValue()Subtype The aspect line contains an additional optional property: the subtype.The subtype can be set by a client or applications in order to carry out use-specific formatting ofvalues in the user interface. The type information for the server is separated from the databaseand formatting information for display in the UI.The subtype is saved by the server but not analyzed.The STATUS type The STATUS aspect line type is designed for values that the user can only select from a pre-definedlist of values, e.g. status information such as "Paid", "Reserved", "Valid", etc.The fixed values are defined in a keyword list for the field.With a status field, the IndexValue in the displayData field has a value translated into the userlanguage as a property. This requires translated values (translation table or properties). Whenchecking out a SORD, the display data values of the IndexValues class, STATUS type, are filled withthe translated value. If this value does not exist, displayData is assigned the string value of the IndexValues class.The keyword list of a type STATUS aspect line also has the translated values: there, they can befound in the Keyword.displayValue field.Mapping the inheritance relationship between metadata forms The inheritance hierarchy of the metadata forms (see section Inheritance relationships betweenmetadata forms) is implemented by another API class: DocMaskInheritThe DocMask class is given an additional field: the list inheritFromMasks.The list contains DocMaskInherit type objects. Each DocMaskInherit object contains the parent ID ofa parent metadata form of the current metadata form.So, each metadata form is "familiar" with all its direct parent metadata forms via this list.protected List<DocMaskInherit>inheritFromMasks;11 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe parent relationship for a metadata form can be set and changed as with all changes bychecking in the metadata form. A separate member flag also exists in the DocMaskC:mbInheritFromMasks class for this.New and changed API classes The following addresses the most important new API classes and the most important additions toexisting classes. The names highlighted in color correspond to the parts of another class with thesame color.12 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationAdditional new API classes Several additional new utility classes have been added to the API:AspectC, AspectLineC, AspectZ, AspectInfo, Cardinality, IndexValueCNew database tables aspectsnamelockidtranslationkeyguidtstampstatuststampsyncpackagenameaspectlinesaspectidlinetypelinedisplaynamelinekeylineflagslineextlinedefault13 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationaspectlineslinenametrkeylinecommentallowedrefmaskidsdynkeywordreferencesubtypelinecommenttrkeyaspectassocmaskidnametranslationkeyaspectidcardinalityacldocmaskinheritparentmaskidchildmaskidAspect object tables The values of the fields</s> 
<s>(IndexValue) are stored in the aspect object tables. This kind of table isgenerated dynamically for each aspect when the aspect is created.An aspect object table is named with asp_<aspectid>, whereby <aspectid> stands for the ID of theaspect.A row in an aspect object table saves an aspect object.An aspect object table has the following columns:ColumnnameType Descriptionobjid int Object ID (sort ID)assoc varchar Name of the aspect mappingordinal intThe position of the aspect object in the list of aspect objects for aspectmapping. Always 0 for not-many cardinality.regionobjid int Reserved for extensionsmaskId int ID of the Sord metadata form.tstamp varchar Timestamp of last changeIndex value One value for each field. The type is determined by the field.14 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationImportant general information Reserved fields The previously reserved fields (e.g. ELO_FNAME) initially remain stored in the structure of theprevious ObjKeys. So, if a SORD is generated with a metadata form, it still contains ObjKeys. TheseObjKeys may only contain the contents of the reserved fields, but no "normal" index values forregular fields.Changes on the search API for the iSearch Preliminary remarks To uniquely reference a field within a metadata form index ini the ELO iSearch in a QueryFilter,previously you only had to specify the key (LineKey) of the metadata form line (DocMaskLine).For metadata forms with aspect data organization, there is also the name of the respective aspectmapping.Create QueryFilter Until now, the field within the metadata form that the filter applied to was specified in the docMaskLine of the QueryFilter. This field is now marked as deprecated.This has been standardized and the indexFieldKey field is now used for previous metadata formswith ObjKey data organization and for metadata forms with aspect data organization. The previousfield docMaskLine is now only evaluated as an alternative if indexFieldKey is empty, and only fornon-aspect metadata forms.For non-aspect metadata forms, the lineKey for the index field still has to be entered. For aspectmetadata form fields, the name of the aspect mapping is followed by the separator "Â¶", followedby the lineKey of the aspect line, i.e. assocNameÂ¶lineKey.Example:Field name within Elasticsearch The schema of the field names in Elasticsearch was retained. ForÂ example, for a tokenized inputfield: LINE_<indexFieldKey>.tokenizedExample:CUSTOMER ADDRESSÂ¶LOCATIONLINE_CUSTOMER ADDRESSÂ¶LOCATION.tokenized15 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationForms (gen. 2) The change to the new metadata model will also be accompanied by a new generation of forms.The new generation of forms is characterized by a more flexible design concept. Current webdesign standards replace the inflexible model of table layouts.Thanks to responsive design, forms can be adapted and displayed on different devices.The new form designer has a fully functional preview.For more information, refer to the ELO packages documentation.Dashboards and ELO Analytics A technical change to the Elasticsearch technology has made it impossible to continue operatingELO Analytics.16 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationELO now offers dashboards instead. These are based on the forms (gen. 2) and can be embeddedinto workspaces as preview elements. They can also be shown in the clients when performing asearch if the respective metadata form has been configured accordingly.Dashboards are configured</s> 
<s>via the metadata forms.For more information, refer to the following sections of the ELO packages documentation:17 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationWorkspaces A workspace is a special area in ELO where the rights are automatically assigned for work groups.Teamspaces can contain a workspace.'Sord.spaceGuid' field A workspace is essentially an ELO folder with a dedicated flag: sord.details.workspace = true.The new property sord.spaceGuid is set for the child elements of this folder. The value of thisproperty is the GUID of the respective workspace where the SORD is located: sord.spaceGuid =workspaceSord.guid. This field spaceGuid is not set for the objects that do not belong to anyworkspace. The property spaceGuid is not set with its own GUID for the workspace folder, as it canbe located in a teamspace. This property is automatically set in the background when creating andmoving an object and cannot be edited manually. During a check-in operation, even with the rightselector SordC.mbSpaceGuid, a modification to the spaceGuid property is simply ignored.X right The X right has been implemented as a right for workspaces in addition to the RWDELP rights.If a user group with the "X" right is added to a child folder in the workspace, the system ensuresthat this group is linked to all groups of the workspace with an AND in terms of permissions. Onlymembers of the group with the X right have access to the object.If another group without the X right is assigned, the folder can be read by all members of thisgroup. In this case, no special AND is formed.With this kind of concept, you no longer have to concern yourself with the AND in reference toworkspace groups, but could allow an object in the workspace to break out in individual cases.The X right for the workspace SORD itself does not have any effect. You can declare a delete rightthat is only applied for workspace child elements but not the workspace folder itself, for example.So we have to differentiate between two types of ACEs on the workspace folder:The workspace folder ACEs without the X right only apply to the workspace folder itself andare not AND-linked to the ACL of the workspace child elements.The workspace folder ACEs with the X right in turn do not have any significance for theworkspace folder itself, but are instead AND-linked to the ACL of the workspace childelements that also have the X right.â€¢ â€¢ 18 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationAdditional changesELO Indexserver The following changes have been made to the ELO Indexserver.Support for Tomcat 10 Apache Tomcat 10 has been supported since ELO 21.4. This occurred at the same time as theswitch to JavaEE 9, which is incompatible with previous versions due to the namespace changefrom javax.servlet to jakarta.servlet. It is necessary to check whether these packages are beingused in web applications or plug-ins that run on Apache Tomcat or ELO Indexserver, and to adaptthem accordingly.Java 17 The ELO Indexserver is now compiled with Java 17, which is now the minimum Java version. TheELO Server Setup updates the environment accordingly.Changes to</s> 
<s>ELO Indexserver status page The information on the status page of the ELO Indexserver and other ELO modules is now onlydisplayed after authentication of the Tomcat account.Without authentication, only the execution status is displayed, e.g. Running. Error messages are nolonger displayed.New error code for failed logon If the session of a client application expired, until now the ELO Indexserver acknowledged the nextcall with the error code IXExceptionC.NOT_FOUND = 5023. This is the case, for example, if theconnection to the LDAP server is temporarily unavailable (if configured). In this case, the clientapplication cannot distinguish whether the sought object cannot be found or the re-logon has faileddepending on the call.A new error code was introduced for this purpose: IXExceptionC.AUTHENTICATION_FAILED = 3008. TheELO Indexserver now returns this code when authentication fails.'IXConnFactory' functions deprecated Because there are now fewer options on the status page, the information about the readStatusPageProperty and readStatusPageProperties functions is no longer available. Thefunctions based on these are therefore deprecated.Deprecated functions:19 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationFunction Behavior AlternativereadStatusPageProperty Returns null NonereadStatusPageProperties Returns empty property object NonegetVersion Returns constant value 23.1.0.0 IXConnection.getVersiongetMajorVersion Returns constant value 23 IXConnection.getMajorVersiongetStatusPageErrors Returns empty array NoneBecause of this change, client libraries of older ELOix versions can no longer access this ELOIndexserver.'OnEnterHandleRollback' and 'OnExitHandleRollBack' script functions In the workflow nodes, you now have access to two more fields with new functions for the scripts:onEnterHandleRollbackonExitHandleRollbackThe functions need the same parameters as the onEnter/onExit methods. To run them in JavaScript,you need to add Node to the function in the script.Example:ci = ClientInfouserId = The ID of the user who processed the workflow nodeworkflow = The active workflownodeId = Workflow node ID where the script isThese functions can only be executed if they are in the script in the field with onEnterHandleRollback. This is similar to the fields with onEnter or onExit.The script in the field with onEnterHandleRollback will only be executed if there is also a script with onEnter in the same node.The same applies for the combination onExitHandleRollback and onExit.The functions onEnterHandleRollback and onExitHandleRollback are not designed to fix errors in therespective scripts with onEnter or onExit, because the scripts in the fields with onEnterHandleRollback and onExitHandleRollback are stored temporarily and are only executed if anerror occurs when forwarding a workflow from one person node (onExit) to the next person node(onEnter).Scripts with onEnterHandleRollback or onExitHandleRollback are only stored temporarily if theassociated script with onEnter or onExit was executed successfully and without errors.The scripts are executed in the following order:â€¢ â€¢ function onEnterHandleRollbackNode(ci, userId, workflow, nodeId)â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 20 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe script with onEnterHandleRollback or onExitHandleRollback that was added last isexecuted first.The script with onEnterHandleRollback or onExitHandleRollback that was added first isexecuted last.Check the files on upload When uploading a document, an Intray file, or an import ZIP, you have the option to check forviruses. You can also specify filters for file extensions and content types that reject certain filetypes or only accept certain file types.InformationIf you use the option values described below,</s> 
<s>you do not need to restart or reload the ELOIndexserver.Check the file content You specify a call line for a program in the options that checks the file content when uploading adocument. The $1 placeholder in the call line is replaced with the file path.If the program returns the code=0, the file is accepted. A different code will abort the upload with an IXExceptionC.INVALID_PARAM ([ELOIX-2000]) message.The program is called with verifyFileUploadCommand and is specified as the instance name _ALL sothat all ELOix instances run the check.In addition, verifyFileUploadTimeoutSeconds can be used to specify the maximum time the programis allowed for a check. If the timeout is exceeded, the ELO Indexserver kills the check program andreturns an error message ELOIX-2000. The default timeout value is 30 seconds.Example:clamdscan --fdpass $1Check the file type In addition to checking the file content, you also have the option to check the file extension, i.e.content type. The allowedFileTypes and disallowedFileTypes options can be used to limit which filetypes can be stored or exclude certain file types. The specifications are a list of file extensions andcontent types separated by semicolons. A type can be specified as a file extension (e.g. .pdf) or asa content type (e.g. application/pdf).Example:.txt;application/pdf;.docxâ€¢ 21 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationEdit localization with keys (Ticket: EIX-2492)Two localizations methods are already offered: the translation table and the properties files underthe repository path Administration // Localization // default or // custom.The translation table has the disadvantage that you cannot assign a neutral key to the localizedtexts. The key is equal to the value in the first column and its translations must be uniquelyassignable.The disadvantage of the properties files is that you can only dynamically add or change values bychecking the file out and in.The translation table now has a translation key, providing a workaround to these disadvantages.Localized texts can be edited with the well-known checkinTranslateTerm function. Users can searchfor texts related to the translation key with the findFirstTranslateTerms function.Example of how to create a translation term TranslateTerm tterm = new TranslateTerm(); tterm.setLangs(new String[] {"de", "en"}); tterm.setTermLangs(new String[] {"AbschlieÃŸen", "Finish"}); tterm.setTranslationKey("my.dialog.finish");String[] termGuids = conn.ix().checkinTranslateTerms(new TranslateTerm[] {tterm}, LockC.NO ); tterm.setGuid(termGuids[0]);22 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationExample of how to find texts in a language Translations can be assigned to a package (TranslateTerm.getPackageName()) and a level(TranslateTerm.getLevel()). This allows them to be transferred from one repository to another byexporting and importing the package.Translation keys must be unique across all packages, but only within a level. This enables you tooverlap the texts of a key at a higher level.If there is no level specified in findFirstTranslateTerms, the function returns the highest-leveltexts.Improvements in handling translations and country and language codes Translations in packages can now be exported and imported.The translations table now supports up to 30 languages.Arabic, Danish, Greek, Finnish, and Turkish have been added to the translations table.IETF language tags are supported. These can consist of a language code according to ISO639-1 and optionally be supplemented by a country code according to ISO 3166.Language and country are passed to the ClientInfo</s>

However, this format is not yet used by default as theclient software cannot currently handle this format. If you still want to create a data set in the newformat, you can set the option ix.feature.preview.enable.newgenarchiveexport=true in the eloixopttable.ELO Textreader (gen. 2) The ELOix now features a new plug-in that sends documents to ELO Textreader (gen. 2) for full textextraction. The ELO Server Setup makes the necessary settings for this when upgrading.ES8 file format The ES8 file format for metadata now includes the JSON representation of an EditInfo object (seeELO Indexserver API documentation). For compatibility reasons, the old format (Windows INI fileformat) can still be read out for Intray entries.

As aresult, the ELO Indexserver cannot establish a database connection to Microsoft SQL Server 2016when connection encryption is enabled.To resolve this, you need to turn off connection encryption in Microsoft SQL Server or update SQLServer to at least version 2017.Encryption of the 'elosetup.conf' file The setup configuration files $HOME$\.elosetup.conf and <elo>\config\serversetup2\elosetup.confare encrypted as of version 21.1.Accordingly, the ELO Server Setup asks for a password ("main password") in a dialog box everytime it is started. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt the configuration files.Unattended installation The unattended installation displays a prompt for the main password in the terminal.To automate this, you can store the password in the environment variable ELO_SETUP_PASSWORD.Decrypt elosetup.conf A feature in the unattended installation outputs the elosetup.conf file as an unencrypted copy.â€¢ â€¢ 30 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationFor more information, refer to the Installation documentation, Advanced > Decrypting the setupconfiguration section.Automatic certificate renewal The unattended installation offers a new function for when certificates need to be automaticallyrenewed on a regular basis.

There are several ways toinstall these updates:Use the newest ELO DVD. This updates Java, Apache Tomcat, and the ELO server all at thesame time.Download and run the newest ELO Server Setup from the ELO SupportWeb. These arereleased more frequently than DVDs.Update individual ELO server applications manually. This is more complicated than the otheroptions, but it ensures that you have the most current version of the application.InformationIn the following paths, replace <ELO> with the directory you installed the ELO ECM Suite to.All of these update options are described in the following.General information Whenever you are updating individual server applications, please read the version notes beforeproceeding. These inform you if an application is dependent on other applications, if you need toupdate configuration files, or take other necessary steps.Update to 21.02 or higher The update to version 21.02 changes the version of the Elasticsearch used. The update toElasticsearch 7.15 requires the Elasticsearch index to be reindexed. The ELO Server Setup deletesexisting indexes during the update.Plan more time than is usually required for an update for the reindex.Alternative: For larger systems (with more than 500,000 documents), create a copy of theproduction system and reindex there.For more information, refer to the Upgrade index and Background reindex documentation.Update to 10.02 or higher Since ELO 10.2, network traffic between ELOix and ELO iSearch is encrypted by default. If there aremultiple ELO iSearch nodes, communication between the nodes is also encrypted. The certificatesrequired for this are generated by the ELO Server Setup during installation, assuming they are notalready available. There is a root certificate and a server certificate signed by the root certificatefor each node.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 3 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/elo-isearch/background-reindex/intro.htmlhttps://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/elo-isearch/background-reindex/intro.htmlThese certificates are stored in the elosetup.conf file. This file is in:<ELO>/config/serversetup2/To enable encrypted communication between these nodes, their certificates must be signed by thesame root certificate.

This includes data suchas font colors, users, workflow templates, keyword lists, metadata forms, folders, and documents.ELO Transport is based on ELO Automation Services (ELOas). You can transfer data entirely usingscripts or ELOas. Alternatively, you can create a transport file with the</s> 
<s>ELO Administration Console(see below) and import it into the target repository with an ELOas ruleset.Requirements Since a few additions have been made in ELOas to enable the ELO Transport module, version8.00.014 of ELOas and version 8.00.045 of the JavaScript libraries are required.The transport system itself includes three JavaScript libraries:tfer: Indexserver JSON objectstfex: Transport exporttfim: Transport importThese libraries provide the functions to export and import zipped JSON objects.Function calls at a glance The export is performed by the doExport function in the tfex library. This is called in a normalELOas ruleset. The function is called with a string containing a JSON object of the areas to beexported and a file name for the ZIP folder to be created.If the transport is created using the ELO Administration Console, the export process should bestarted as follows:â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ <script> var desc = String(Sord.desc); tfex.doExport(desc, "\\\\testmachine\\temp\\json.zip");</script><script> var desc = String(ix.downloadAsString(Sord)); tfex.doExport(desc, "\\\\testmachine\\temp\\json.zip");</script>12 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe areas to be exported can be defined directly as a string in the ruleset. However, it is moreflexible if they are saved in a separate document or folder (for example, in the extra text area ofthe metadata). The ruleset is then triggered for the object, reads the extra text, and runs the exportfunction. It usually makes the most sense to place the export process in a triggered ruleset(<interval>0M</interval>).The import is triggered by the checkForImport function in the tfim library. The call checks whether atransport file is available, then processes it if it is found. Only the name of the expected transportfile is transferred as parameter. After processing, the file is renamed or deleted. This ruleset callcan occur in fixed intervals, since if a transport file is missing, no actions can be initiated. However,it can also be triggered manually.<script> tfim.checkForImport(""\\\\testmachine\\temp\\json.zip");</script>13 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationArchitecture Upon export, a transport file is generated that contains all objects from the transport definition.This transport file is a normal ZIP file, and each object is its own file object within the ZIP datastream. Within the transport file, all objects are identified by their GUID. The only exception to thisis the markers, which do not possess their own GUID. Therefore, they can only be transferred 1:1 ina block.Transferring the file from the export source to the import directory is not part of the standardproduct. It must be implemented within each project according to the requirements of the situation.In the simplest case, however, export and import can use a common transfer directory.If the copying is performed manually or with a separate program, please note that the generationof the import file must be an atomic process. This means that the import file (json.zip in theexample) may at no point exist only partially. In such cases, the worst-case scenario would be thatthe import process starts with an incomplete file, then cancels or generates an incompletetransport. The simplest way to fulfill this requirement is to copy the file to the target directoryunder a different name, then rename it to the correct one. The export works</s> 
<s>in the same way,which makes it possible to configure the export and import directly to the same directory.Upon import, the transport file is read out in the same order in which it was written. Therefore, ifthe ZIP folder is edited by other programs, care should be taken to retain the same file order.Otherwise it may lead to incomplete or erroneous imports. Each partial file in the ZIP foldercontains a JSON object with data about the entry. Only documents have an additional stream withthe file contents. Upon import, first an attempt is made to read in an object based on its GUID. If italready exists, it is updated using the transport data. If it does not exist, it is created.Folders and documents play a special role in this. These objects do not only have their own GUID,but rather also contain a parent GUID that defines their filing location. If the parent does not exist,the object cannot be created and the transport will cancel. However, the parent GUID is onlyrequired and checked for new objects. If an object already exists, the parent GUID will be ignored.Objects will also not be moved within the target repository after creation. This makes it possible forpartial trees in the source repository to be structured differently from the target repository.Reassignments in the target repository will not be reversed by subsequent transports.14 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationExport The export process expects a JSON object and a description of the objects to be transported. Youcan currently transfer the following objects:Font colorsUsersWorkflow templatesKeyword listsFormsFoldersDocumentsThe objects to be exported must be added to the description in the order shown above. Otherwise,for example, a metadata form could be imported for which no corresponding workflow templateexists. If objects are not added in this order, the administrator must ensure that all dependentobjects exist.(tbc.)â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ {"type": "marker", "filter": ""},{"type": "user", "guid": "(3B8E73FC-F743-D0DF-3C6E-BEFE9620CDCF)"},{"type": "user", "guid": "(809543F8-3659-5199-A81F-41AA330A9EF8)"},{"type": "wftemplate", "guid": "(0B5E6CDB-129D-E9DD-64D6-F334DAF361A5)"},{"type": "keywords", "guid": "ABCDA"},{"type": "mask", "guid": "27"},{"type": "mask", "guid": "8"},{"type": "mask", "guid": "(52952663-E6DB-4D49-BBCE-F5049D4128F4)"},{"type": "sord", "guid": "(278AEB0A-CB83-95EA-F064-F5790BDF48FB)"},{"type": "sord", "guid": "(FF0D4E6F-4BDD-AA35-C6AC-1798E677A830)", "createPath": "ARCPATH:Â¶Local folderÂ¶Transfer"}15 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationWith the ELO Administration Console You can create a new transport file in the ELO Transport menu in the ELO Administration Console.The information is stored in a file that can be imported into an ELO repository.The ELO Transport configuration is filed to the // ELOas Base // TransferConfig folder as a JSON file.In this case, the JSON configuration can be read as follows and used in the ELOas rule for export:Create transport file InformationTo view a drop-down list in an input field, you need to move the cursor over the input fieldand press the space key.New transport file: Click the green button with the white plus sign to create a new transport file.Font colors (markers): Font colors can be transferred along with the transport file.Users: Enter the user and group to be transferred here.Individual keyword lists (keywords): Enter the keyword lists to be transferred here.Metadata forms (masks): Enter the metadata forms to be transferred here.Folders</s>

The batch file only ensures that the programis started with the local Java version.You will achieve the best performance by running it on the PostgreSQL server. However, you can runit on any client computer.The older version of the migration program used a SQL script file, which contained the structure ofthe database. The appropriate script had to be selected for each ELO version. This is no longernecessary or possible in the current version. Since additional tables are created dynamically for theaspects from version ELO 21, you can no longer work with a static database description. Instead,the migration program reads the structure of the source database and uses this information tocreate the target database..\bin\javaw.exe com.elo.ms2pgsql.App20 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationMigration After starting, the Microsoft SQL Server is queried with the source database.You need to enter the server URL and account that has full access to the source data.When you click Next, the database connection is tested.21 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationIf you can't access the server, the program stops on the Source tab and an error message isdisplayed.If you entered an invalid URL, a longer timeout from the network layer can delay the errormessage.If the connection is established, the program proceeds to the Destination tab.22 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThis is where you enter the parameters for the target database server.Please noteAlways end the target URL with the character '/'. Also, it must not contain the name of thedatabase. These are only</s> 
<s>specified on the next tab when selecting the databases. Theselected user must have sufficient rights to create databases.When you click Next, the connection is tested again. The program only proceeds to the Databasestab if a connection can be established.23 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationOn the Databases tab, you can select the databases that you want to migrate. You can onlyselected database names that do not exist on the target server. Hybrid databases are not possible.InformationIf the migration is terminated or needs to be repeated for some other reason, you first needto delete the existing database. However, you don't need to abort the migration program. Inthis case, you can go back to the previous tab, delete the database, and then proceed to the Databases tab again. The databases are read again and checked.Click Next to proceed to the Migrate tab.24 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationYou can set the following options:Test mode: In this mode, the database is created and all tables are copied. However, amaximum of 50,000 rows are copied from each table. This allows you to do a quick test topinpoint fundamental issues. An estimate of the time required to complete the migration isindicated at the end.Use batch mode: This option transfers the data to the PostgreSQL database in batch mode. Itis about 10 times faster but has the disadvantage that if an error occurs, it is hard to tellwhich entry is causing the problem. In this case, you can disable the batch mode and look atthe report file to find out where the error has occurred.Click Start Migration to start the migration.â€¢ â€¢ 25 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationDuring migration, the metadata of the source database is read first. Next, the target database iscreated, the tables within the database are generated, and the data is copied. Finally, thesequences of the source database are read and replicated in the target database. All steps areshown in the status display and a bar indicates the progress of the copy operation.Please noteWith very large tables, the check at the end of the copy operation can take a long time tocomplete.For unknown reasons, the COUNT(*) operation under PostgreSQL is very expensive. Inaddition, the SELECT operation is expensive for tables with a timestamp column, becausethis SELECT needs an ORDER BY <timestamp column> so that the entries can be entered on thetarget page in the correct order. If the progress bar remains at these points for a long time, itis not a sign that the program is not responding.26 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationIf migration is successful, the report is automatically displayed and the Cancel button is renamedto Close and displayed in green.27 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationThe report file can be saved for documentation purposes. It contains all the important steps of themigration. You can see which tables were created and copied, how many data sets they eachcontained, and which sequences were created.If several databases were migrated simultaneously, the report contains a separate section for eachdatabase along with information about</s> 
<s>whether any errors occurred:Finally, there is a text at the end that indicates whether all databases were copied without errors orwhether there were problems in a database.MIGRATION OF DATABASE TEAMROOM DONE, NO ERRORS REPORTED.Migration done, no errors reported.28 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationError control When doing a migration, there is always a risk that a problem or incompatibility will occur at somepoint that prevents you from migrating the database. Several checks were integrated into themigration program to minimize this risk. All errors that are detected are listed in the report. Theadministrator must decide how to fix the problems (e.g. missing permissions, insufficient memory),whether the problems were only temporary (network malfunction), or whether they can be fixedmanually at the SQL level.The migration program lists in the first section of the report which tables were excluded from themigration. In the case of older repositories, these are tables that existed in previous ELO versionsbut are no longer used in current ELO versions (e.g. the old com* tables):Next, the report lists that the database was created and which tables were created:If not all tables were visible to the migration program due to permission restrictions, the programdoes detect this automatically. If there is any doubt, the administrator must manually compare thenumber of tables.In the next step, the table contents are copied. The migration program lists how many entries werecopied for each table:Report started at 2021-04-102 12:59:335.Migrate database Teamroom. Read metatdata.

Inconsistencies are listed as errors in the report.There is also an error message if an error occurs while writing the data:In test mode, the following information is displayed in the case of larger tables:The migration program indicates that the report table has 1,410,254 rows but only the first 50,000of them were migrated. Therefore, only 50,000 rows are expected in the target table, and were alsofound.At the end of the report, you will find information about the time elapsed and an estimate of thetime required to complete the migration.Copy database content.Migrate table 'activity'.Migration check ok at activity - rows expected: 0, found: 0Migrate table 'actopt'.Migration check ok at actopt - rows expected: 15, found: 15Migrate table 'alerts'.Migration check ok at alerts - rows expected: 0, found: 0Migrate table 'arcsync'.Migration check ok at arcsync - rows expected: 0, found: 0Migrate table 'dochistory'.Migration check ok at dochistory - rows expected: 14859, found: 14859Migrate table 'dochistory'.

Since no database error occurred, only a difference in the number of expectedrows was detected. Database errors usually occur when saving, e.g. due to lack of memory. In thiscase, the error is also indicated in the user interface and the report:If errors occur while the report is being written, they cannot of course be written to the report. Thiscan be the case if the temp directory is full, for example.In this case, a warning is displayed in the user interface that the report file is incomplete.Migrate table 'elocolor'.ERROR: (E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E20) :: ERROR: Value too long for type character varying(10)ERROR: (E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E21) :: ERROR: Value too long for type character varying(10)ERROR: (E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E22) :: ERROR: Value too long for type character varying(10)ERROR: (E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E23) :: ERROR: Value too long for type character varying(10)ERROR: ### Migration error at elocolor - rows expected: 4, found: 0, items read: 432 ELO server â€’ Installation and operationFinal remarks Even though the migration program takes many precautions to prevent or at least indicate errorsduring migration, the administrator is still required to conduct extensive testing to see if the datawas migrated completely and the target repository is working correctly.The migration program only copies the database tables and the sequences. Indexes are not copiedbecause they are checked by the ELO Indexserver at startup and automatically created wherenecessary. If you created your own indexes manually in the source repository, you also need tocreate them manually in the target repository after migration. This means that the ELO Indexservercan take a long time to start after the migration since it needs to create and populate all indexes atthis point.The same applies for views. These are not copied either because they are automatically created bythe ELO Indexserver. Custom views have to be created manually after the migration.The migration program dynamically copies the database structure and could theoretically also copythird-party databases. However, we do not recommend this, as we only work with database partsand data types that are used in an ELO environment. The migration also performs a few ELO-specific conversions, e.g. MS Timestamp columns (which do not contain a timestamp but a kind of64-bit transaction counter) are converted to BIGINT columns and any NOT NULL values are removed(since these columns are not frequently used by the ELO Indexserver and are therefore no longercompleted).33 ELO server â€’</s>

Bycontrast, ELOenterprise is platform-independent.Unlike ELOenterprise, ELOprofessional is not multi-tenant capable.ELOprofessional systems are only cluster-ready to a certain extent. They only allow for hotstandby operation of individual components. ELOenterprise systems, however, are fullycluster-ready.With ELOprofessional, server processes may only be distributed within the same host, i.e. ona server system. By contrast, with ELOenterprise processes can be distributed acrossmultiple hosts (VMs or physical servers).With ELOprofessional, the ELO server components (e.g. ELOas) can be distributed acrossmultiple Tomcat servers as long as they are located on one server system (VM or physicalserver).

<s>ELO Smart Input | ELO Smart InputELO Smart InputELO Smart InputTable of contentsELO Smart InputIntroduction Installation Enable full text Configuration Metadata mapping Regular expressions Data sets Tiles FAQ Troubleshooting 2 ELO Smart InputELO Smart InputIntroduction Overview ELO Smart Input is an intelligent assistant that helps you enter metadata for incoming documentssemi-automatically.This module analyzes the full text of a document and extracts data from it, such as addresses,sums, or e-mail addresses. You can then simply select from the suggested metadata options thatare shown. The suggestions must be checked and saved manually. In the ELO Smart Inputconfiguration, you can add regular expressions to search for specific information in documents andcompare matches against existing database tables.You can use ELO Smart Input with the ELO Java Client and the ELO Web Client.How it works ELO Smart Input is based on an incoming and target folder principle.The incoming folder is where you save documents that have not yet been assignedmetadata.Use ELO Smart Input to enter the metadata for the documents.After the metadata is entered, the documents are moved to a defined target folder.The folder and appearance of the tile have to be defined in the ELOsi Administration interface first.You can then switch to the ELO Smart Input interface. You will reach the interface via the tilenavigation in the ELO Web Client or ELO Java Client.3 ELO Smart InputUse Fig.: ELO Smart Input suggestions in the ELO Web ClientELO Smart Input is an interactive assistant that helps you enter metadata for incoming documentssemi-automatically. The module analyzes the full text of a document and extracts data from it,such as addresses, sums, or e-mail addresses. Users receive suggestions for automaticallydetected data, which they can apply to the metadata. Selected suggestions are highlighted in blue.If the suggestion isn't correct, you can either select one of the alternative suggestions or completethe field manually.Click Save to finish entering the metadata.The document is moved to the filing path defined in the configuration.What can be recognized? Many patterns are offered out-of-the-box:E-mails, date values, times, IBANs, VAT IDs, URLsAddresses (Germany-wide)Sums (including gross value, net value, and VAT recognition)Values of ELO keyword listsWith a regular expression, you can define, extend, and make changes to custom patterns (suchÂ as aspecific ID pattern). You can also import data sets from CSV or TSV files or databases.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 4 ELO Smart InputAutomatic classification ELO Smart Input has an integrated automatic document classifier. For each document, the systemidentifies the likely document type (e.g. invoice, deliveryÂ note, advertisement) and what metadataform is most relevant. Of course, only metadata forms that have a mapping definition are selected.The classifier is universal and self-learning, meaning it works for every language, document type,and metadata form. It learns with each document whose metadata has been saved via ELO SmartInput, becoming more and more accurate over time.Please noteWe recommend saving documents with the appropriate metadata form right from the startto quickly improve the classifier's learning curve.If the document already has a metadata form a mapping has been defined for, the classifier isskipped. The system</s> 
<s>assumes that the document is already assigned the correct metadata form.Differences between the ELO Java Client and ELO Web Client Both clients have advantages and disadvantages when using ELO Smart Input.The ELO Java Client features Click OCR to quickly complete the metadata with the click of a mouse.In the web view component, the date and list fields are rendered as normal fields.The ELO Web Client has a date picker, lists with drop-down menus, and autocomplete, provided youuse an up-to-date browser. Click OCR is not possible in the ELO Web Client.5 ELO Smart InputInstallation Installation with the ELO Server Setup This module is installed using the ELO Server Setup.In the ELO Server Setup, switch to the Applications tab.In your repository area, select the ELO Smart Input application from the drop-down menu andclick Add.Fig.: Adding ELO Smart Input in the ELO Server SetupELO Smart Input is added to the list of applications and installed after confirming on the next tab â€“ Confirm.Opening the 'ELOsi administration' interface You can reach the ELO Smart Input administration interface in two ways:â€¢ 6 ELO Smart InputVia Server modules in the ELO Administration Console Fig.: Opening the administration interface via the ELO Administration ConsoleVia the ELOis status page. You will find the ELOsi Administration button at the top right. Fig.: ELOsi status, 'ELOsi Administration' buttonDifferences between version 20 and 21 The names of the content types have changed between these two versions. They shouldautomatically be updated on start-up. If you encounter any problems, check to make sure thedifferent mappings are correct.The format of the file for the addresses has also changed compared with ELO 20. A header hasbeen added. If you use your own files for addresses, update them and add them to the header. Thenew format also uses the TABULATOR key as a separator, but the separator ";" is also compatible,meaning that only the header should be added (with the TABULATOR key or ";" including theexclamation point).Upgrading from version 12 to version 21 When installing ELO Smart Input using the ELO 21 Server Setup, a previous ELO Smart Keywordinginstallation with ELO 12 is not recognized.Follow the steps below before starting the ELO 21 Server Setup for this reason.â€¢ â€¢ 7 ELO Smart InputUninstall ELO Smart Keywording: On the Tomcat administration page, click undeploy next to SK.If the former module was not uninstalled completely (may be the case with earlierversions): Stop Tomcat.In the folder <elo-tomcat-dir>/webapps, delete the file sk.war and the folder sk.Delete the folder <elo-tomcat-dir>/config/sk.Install ELO Smart Input using the ELO Server Setup.Restore the old configuration: In ELO, rename the Administration/ELOsk Base folder Administration/ELOsi Base.If data tables were configured in ELO Smart Keywording, copy them to the new ELOSmart Input data directory.Restart ELO Smart Input.Delete the tiles in the ELO Smart Input administrative area and create them again.â—¦ â—¦ â–ª â–ª â—¦ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ 8 ELO Smart InputEnable full text For quick document processing, the relevant documents should already be filed to ELO and addedto the full text database.

However, this would resultin drastic delays, as OCR processing would be used instead.<server name>:<Port>/<repository name>/tr?__cmd__=status9 ELO Smart InputConfiguration ELOÂ SmartÂ Input is configured for Germany by default. Some settings can be customized for use inother countries. These country-specific settings are made in the installation path and require you torestart ELO Smart Input.AddressesÂ The SI package is supplied with German addresses as standard. You will find this CSV file in thefolder /addresses/. There, you can add additional files as address databases. Multiple files can beadded. Make sure that these files are always UTF-8 encoded and that they have the same header.Please noteThe format of the file for addresses changed between version 20 and 21.Street names are abbreviated (TÃ¼binger Str.) or written out (TÃ¼binger StraÃŸe). There is anothersetting in the config.properties for this:If you work withÂ English addresses, for example, you should change it as follows:These settings are case-insensitive and only one abbreviation is possible.To find out whether the street number is expected before the street name, which is common insome countries, you can use this setting:Date formatÂ Dates are recognized in various formats, including as text suchÂ as "1 January 2021". By default,German and English written date values are recognized.If you want French and Italian date values to be recognized, adjust the config.properties asfollows:# Default valuesstreetShort = str.streetLong = straÃŸestreetShort = st.streetLong = street# DefaultstreetAfterHouseNumber = false10 ELO Smart InputWe recommend keeping the list of recognized languages to a minimum.VAT ELO Smart Input can recognize values such as the gross amount, net amount, and VAT providedthey comply with the valid VAT rates. The German VAT rates are configured by default. For otherlanguages, you can make changes via <elo-si-config-path>/config.properties.Please noteIn version 20, this variable was called vatPercents and has been renamed taxes in version21.If there is a VAT of zero percent in the country, you will also have to enter 0.Restricting options If you want more or fewer results to be offered in the interface, you can use this setting:Resetting the classifier Sometimes metadata forms change, or you may want to file documents differently, for examplebecause certain requirements have changed.In such a situation, it may be beneficial to reset the classifier so that the configured form is nolonger offered.To reset the classifier, proceed as follows:Stop ELO Smart Input.Delete the raw data model files (document word statistics) under <elo-sk-data>/classifier*.Restart ELO Smart Input.You can disable the classifier if you don't want it for some reason:Edit the file <elo-sk-config>/config.properties.Add classify = false.datesLanguages = fr, it# Valid taxes in %taxes = 5, 7, 16, 19# The maximum number of alternatives offeredchoicesLimit = 411 ELO Smart InputRestart ELO Smart Input.12 ELO Smart InputMetadata mapping Metadata mapping From</s> 
<s>the standpoint of the software, a field in the metadata is simply a data type, such as text. ELOSmart Input first has to define what should be allocated to the field (e.g. e-mail, streetÂ name, IBAN).This is done via mapping. In the bar on the left in the Metadata mapping area, you will see a list ofavailable metadata forms. To define a mapping, select a metadata form.Fig.: Metadata mappingIn the example above, the first four fields (fax, telephone, e-mail, IBAN) are individual fields. Thelast four fields (name, street, city, country) are group fields. The child entries of the group (in Fig. Metadata mapping the Address group) belong together. If you select a child entry, all relevant childentries of the group are filled in.There are two group fields defined in ELO Smart Input: addresses and sums. Both group fields havea limited number of child fields.In the Filing path field, you can define where documents with metadata are filed. For this path, youcan use constants or variables from the metadata.If no fields are defined for a metadata form, you can generate a mapping for all contained fields byclicking Create all form fields.Alternatively, you can click Add value and Add group of values to create your own mappings.In the Name area you will see the field name followed by the corresponding field template.In the Contents area, select the relevant pattern. ELO Smart Input recognizes several predefinedpatterns, which you can select from the drop-down menu.13 ELO Smart InputPreconfigured patterns ELO Smart Input recognizes the following patterns by default:Addresses Germany-wideAmounts Everything with two decimal pointsGross, net, and VAT are recognizedDate values In different forms (06/21/2021 or June 21, 2021)German and English formats as standardCurrencies â‚¬, $, Â£, Â¥E-mail addressesIBAN Global formatsTelephone numbers HeuristicVAT ID European formatsYou can also add your own regular expressions and data tables as described in the chapters Regularexpressions and Data sets.The following table contains example values for the content types (patterns) available in ELOSmart Input:Content type Example (recognized) Example (output)address.city Stuttgart Stuttgartstuttgart StuttgartSTUTTGART Stuttgartaddress.countryCode - DEaddress.houseNumber (street name) 43 43address.name ELO Digital Office GmbH Heuristicaddress.postCode 70178 70178address.state - *(Planned for a later release)address.street TÃ¼binger Str.

Once the regular expression has been created, you can select it inthe Metadata mapping area. Multiple patterns may have the same name. This allows you to usemultiple different regular expressions for recognition suchÂ as https?://.+ and www\..+ as a URLpattern for a pattern name.Fig.: 'Contents' tab: example regular expressionsIn the Name area, enter a name for the pattern.In the Regular expression area, you enter the regular expression.If you only want to filter a portion of the defined regular expression, you can restrict it via the Transformation field. If you enter $1 as shown on the 'Contents' tab: example regular expressionsfor example, only the content of the first bracket is taken over.Clicking the Test button opens the Tester dialog box.17 ELO Smart InputFig.: 'Tester' dialog box for testing regular expressionsHere, you can test the defined regular expression. Enter an example text to the input field. Theresults of the regular expression search are shown below the input field.Defining multiple regular expressions for a content type It is also possible to configure multiple regular expressions per content type. We will illustrate thisbased on an example.Scenario The product IDs allow for an old format 123-456-678 and a new format ABC/123/XYZ.Method Instead of writing a complex regular expression to match both, you can define both formatsseparately.Name Regular expressionproduct_id \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}product_id [A-Z]{3}/\d{3}/[A-Z]{3}Everything matching the defined regular expressions is considered a valid product_id.18 ELO Smart InputExtending preconfigured content types with regular expressions Existing content types can be extended, see the following example.Scenario By default, the content type credit_card can only recognize normal credit card numbers suchÂ as 1234-1234-1234-1234. However, you want to recognize masked credit card numbers as well, suchÂ as1234-1234-1234-XXXX.Method To enable this, you can add a regular expression also named credit_card suchÂ as:Name Regular expressioncredit_card \d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-XXXXThe content type credit_card would find two variants:1234-1234-1234-1234 (default)1234-1234-1234-XXXX (additional definition)Please noteGroup content types such as addresses or data sets cannot be extended with regularexpressions.â€¢ â€¢ 19 ELO Smart InputData sets One typical scenario is searching for specific data in a document that cannot be identified by aregular expression, but instead by an external data source. Examples include project IDs, referencenumbers, and customer names. With ELO Smart Input, you can integrate external data sources anduse them to find IDs and add metadata.Import CSV/TSV file On the Data tab, you can add your own data sets for ELO Smart Input. Click Upload file to upload asmany data sets as you'd like.The file has to be a *.tsv (tab-separated values) or *.csv (comma-separated values) file. Note thefollowing:The first line should be the header, which contains the column names (without whitespaces,without special characters).The file must be</s> 
<s>UTF-8 formatted.The first column is added as the index as default to be able to search in the document.Example data set from generated random data:IfÂ the document contains 3D4PG4FB1BT562959 for example, it will be found. Values such as Ford or 1992 are also offered as additional information for the metadata.Import via SQL database You can also import data sets from an SQL database. In the Data area, click Import from SQLdatabase.There, you then have to enter the URL to the JDBC database, for example:jdbc:sqlserver://<db-server>:1433;databaseName=testdbjdbc:postgresql://<db-server>:5432/testdbjdbc:db2://<db-server>:50000/testdbjdbc:oracle:thin:@<db-server>:1521/testdb.localdomainAfter clicking Import from SQL database, the snapshot is copied in full.You can use any SQL statement.

This could be differentcompanies, such as associations in the construction sector, but it can also be relevant within thecompany if different departments have their own repositories. The ELO Teamroom service wasdeveloped for these applications.If a user wants to share contents for a project in a folder, the user can create a teamroom. This newfolder is marked in the main repository as a Teamroom folder and a teamroom with the same nameis created on the ELO Teamroom server. The folder contents are then synchronized as follows.Essentially, the ELO Teamroom server is a normal ELO installation. However, it can be located inthe cloud, DMZ, or on the local network as needed.Please noteThe ELO Teamroom server requires a separate license. The license for the main repositorycannot be duplicated. Request an ELO Teamroom server license before installation.3 ELO TeamroomInstallationIntroduction and requirementsThis documentation describes a scenario for the complete installation of all components of anenvironment with ELO Teamroom on Microsoft Windows.

<s>option and setting an info value, not every interim version is transferredto the main repository when edited in the Teamroom. The marker is then reset once the finalversion is complete. This version is then synchronized.Example: lock_remote=4oricon: If a folder is registered as a teamroom, you can automatically change the folder iconto another (teamroom) icon. The service saves the ID of the original icon in this field. Thisinformation is used to be able to configure the original icon when the teamroom is deleted.Example: oricon=3Metadata form configuration In the simplest case, only documents without any metadata are managed in the teamroom. In thiscase, the default mapping that covers all documents with the Basic Entry metadata form and allfolders with the Folder metadata form suffices. In practice, however, you will likely need additionalmetadata in the Teamroom.Creating metadata forms in the teamroom If you want the metadata form in the teamroom to be identical to the metadata form in the mainrepository, the easiest option is to export a document/folder with this form from the mainrepository and import it into the Teamroom repository. During import, any metadata forms that donot yet exist are created automatically. If you want to make changes to the metadata form later on,you will have to do so in both the teamroom and the main repository. Automatic synchronization isnot available in ELO Teamroom.You may not want to see the entire metadata from the main repository, for example, if multiplefields are confidential. In this case, create the metadata form in the teamroom with just some ofthe metadata fields. The fields have the same group names, which simplifies configurationsignificantly.â—¦ â€¢ â€¢ 41 ELO TeamroomYou have to enter the metadata form definition globally in the ELO Administration Console of themain repository under Solutions > Teamroom > Form templates.InformationAlternatively, you can also change the metadata form configuration in the individualteamrooms under Solutions > Teamroom > Teamrooms > Edit form templates button.Add new metadata form: Click the Add new metadata form button (plus icon) to addmetadata forms to the default ones. You need to map the names of metadata form in themain repository to the ones in the Teamroom repository.Add mapping: Click the Add mapping button to map fields from the main repository to fieldsin the Teamroom repository. To do so, use the group names of the respective fields.When creating a new teamroom, the global configuration is automatically copied to the teamroomconfiguration folder and can then be customized there.From a technical standpoint, the form templates are saved in folders and extra texts. In practice,this is irrelevant thanks to the configuration application.Technical background To simplify troubleshooting, the following explains the logic behind this.You can either store the metadata form definitions for all teamrooms under // Administration //Teamroom // template, or separately for each teamroom at Administration // Teamroom // rooms //<Teamroom Name>.â€¢ â€¢ 42 ELO TeamroomTo map metadata forms, a child folder with a formatted name is created in the Teamroom folder.The following applies:Document forms: MAP_D [form in main repository]->[form in Teamroom repository]Folder forms: MAP_O [form in</s> 
<s>main repository]->[form in Teamroom repository]Please noteThe name of the metadata form in the Teamroom repository must not be a wildcard.When synchronizing a document, the server first checks whether there is a 1:1 mapping with themetadata form name. If this is not the case, next it checks whether a wildcard mapping isavailable. If this mapping also does not exist, the document is excluded from synchronization.Examples In this example, the documents with the E-mail metadata form will be synchronized. In the mainrepository, this form is called Email and in the Teamroom repository it is E-mail. These differentspellings do not prevent synchronization. The mapping must look like this:MAP_D EMail->E-mailYou can also set the configuration to map all (other) folders from the main repository to the Foldersmetadata form in the Teamroom repository:MAP_0*->Foldersâ€¢ â€¢ 43 ELO TeamroomIf you do not configure it like this, you will have to list all metadata forms whose documents/foldersyou want to synchronize. You can also use this method to exclude specific confidential informationthat have an own metadata form from being synchronized.To synchronize the field contents, you will have to define what fields you want to transfer in theextra text of the metadata form.In the simplest case, all fields are copied with the same group name. Use the followingconfiguration:*=*If the metadata forms differ, the group names may also differ. In this case, you will have toexplicitly list the mapping. List all fields whose content you want to transfer in the following way:<field in the main repository>=<field in the Teamroom repository>During synchronization, the system first looks for an explicit mapping. If none is found, the systemchecks for a wildcard mapping. If no wildcard mapping exists, the field is not synchronized.44 ELO TeamroomOperationIntroduction You will find information on operating ELO Teamroom in the following sections:License managementTeamroom life cycleEventsConditions and limitationsâ€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 45 ELO TeamroomLicense management External teamroom users are licensed differently from internal ELO users. Internal ELO users arecovered by the main repository's license. On the main repository end, users become teamroomparticipants by adding them to the Teamroom Users group. As teamroom participants directly orindirectly perform a number of write operations, they are automatically "write users". This meansthere are no read-only teamroom users.The license for the Teamroom repository contains information about the number of permittedexternal users. This number is checked and logged by the ELO Teamroom service. Provided thesystem is licensed correctly, the number of active users is logged in the status.If the number of licensed users is only exceeded slightly, a warning appears on the status page, butthe system continues running normally.In case of a major license violation, synchronization is stopped. Teamroom users can continueworking normally, but no more data is transferred to or from the main repository.Locked users or users without interactive logon are not counted if the last time they logged on wasmore than 14 days in the past. Former teamroom users should therefore be locked in the ELOAdministration Console for security and licensing reasons.46 ELO TeamroomTeamroom life cycle All ELO users in the sol.teamroom.roles.Creator group can request</s> 
<s>teamrooms. This is done usingthe New teamroom button on the ribbon (ELO 12: Teamroom -> New teamroom, ELO 20 and higher:New -> Self-service -> New teamroom) or by clicking the New teamroom tile. The ELO user needsthe right Start workflows to be able to do this.The system uses the ELO Business Solutions template concept. The templates for new teamroomsare located under Administration//Business Solutions Custom//elo.teamroom.Local//Configuration//Teamroom types.Create new teamroom If there are multiple templates, clicking New teamroom opens a dialog box to select a type.47 ELO TeamroomIf there is only one template, the sol.teamroom.teamroom.create workflow starts immediately andthe dialog box for the first user node opens.In the dialog box, enter a name and optionally a description for the teamroom. Clicking OK initiatesthe (optional) approval process for the teamroom.48 ELO TeamroomApproval process You can configure the approval process for the teamroom in the configuration interface of the ELOAdministration Console under Dynamic user roles.The decision of who the teamroom is sent to for approval is made based on the APPROVAL role.The mechanism is the same as with Business Solution ELO Invoice. By default, the user group sol.teamroom.roles.Approver is configured here. In the simplest case, all you have to do is addusers to this role.You can also leave the APPROVAL role empty; the approval process is then skipped.The approving user has the option to approve or reject the teamroom, or to return the workflowback to the previous user.After approval has been granted, the ELO Teamroom service creates the teamroom folder andsynchronization begins.49 ELO TeamroomA technical folder for the configuration data of the new teamroom is created under Administration//Teamroom//rooms and the data folder is created under Teamroom. The service creates a newTeamroom repository using the default configuration from the main repository. After this, theteamroom is available.Before the teamroom folder in the main repository is filled with data for synchronization, you cancustomize the configuration. This includes:Configuring mapping of metadata forms for synchronization.Assigning permissions to other users in the main repository to the Teamroom folder. Thisfolder inherits permissions of the selected folder where the reference to the Teamroom folderis created.In the Teamroom repository, you can configure templates for creating and filing entries forthe new teamroom if you want to deviate from the default.Initial documents and entries can be moved to or created in the Teamroom folder and users invitedto the teamroom via the ELO Teamroom Client.ELO Teamroom Client The teamroom can be accessed in the Teamroom repository via the ELO Teamroom Client. This isdelivered via ELOwf and called from the URL:The ELO Teamroom Client contains all entries from the main repository according to theconfiguration (e.g. form mapping).Permissions The permissions are not applied, as the users in the Teamroom repository are different from thosein the main repository. Instead, each teamroom is based on three groups created dynamically:ModeratorMemberGuestThese groups are created for each teamroom. All entries in the teamroom have the followingpermissions:Moderator: R,W,E,D,L,PMember: R,W,E,LGuest: RThe creator of the teamroom is automatically added to the Moderator group. As moderator, theycan add existing users to their teamroom in the ELO Teamroom Client</s> 
<s>or invite external users. Inboth cases, they assign a role (moderator, member, guest) for the new users in this teamroom.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ <server>/ix-<repository>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/wf/apps/app/elo.teamroom.Client/â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 50 ELO TeamroomExisting users are all users existing in the Teamroom repository. Either they are automaticallycreated from the Teamroom Users group in the main repository (and are now in the ELO Usersgroup in the Teamroom repository) or these are external users that have already been invited toother teamrooms.To create an external user that does not yet exist, you have to enter a role, e-mail address, anduser name. The user is then created, added to the group corresponding to their role in theteamroom, then the sol.teamroom.SendRegistration workflow is started. The user receives an e-mail notification at the specified address requesting to set a password. Users created externally arealso added to the Teamroom Members group.While a teamroom is running, exclusive groups determine who can edit what entries. Changes aresynchronized back to the main repository via the ELO Teamroom Service according to theconfiguration. Changes to the entries in the main repository are also synchronized to the Teamroomrepository.Close teamroom Ending a teamroom is currently equivalent to stopping synchronization. Members with the sol.teamroom.roles.Creator and sol.teamroom.roles.Administrator roles can perform this on theteamroom entry by clicking Close teamroom.51 ELO TeamroomThe user can set the closing time in a dialog box.The process of closing is performed by a technical user (ELO Service). The ELO Teamroom servicemarks the corresponding teamroom and synchronizes it for the last time after a specified timeperiod. After that, the synchronization is complete. The period is used to notify any active usersthat the teamroom has been closed and to allow them to save their data.The data for a closed teamroom still exists in both repositories, but it is no longer synchronized.You can no longer view this data using the ELO Teamroom Client. Existing entries may still appearin the user's My ELO work area.Delete teamroom With the Delete teamroom button, users with the role sol.teamroom.roles.Administrator canremove a teamroom that has already been closed from the Teamroom repository. This deletes all52 ELO Teamroomdata from the Teamroom repository but it remains in the main repository. The process of deletion isperformed by a technical user (ELO Service).53 ELO TeamroomEvents The system offers various mechanisms for configuring events in terms of the life cycle of ateamroom.Main repository In the configuration interface of the ELO Administration Console, various post-processing processescan be configured for different events.Both workflows and registered ELO Indexserver functions can be started once the events occur.However, if a teamroom has been deleted, only registered functions can be started, as theteamroom folder (which a workflow would be started on) no longer exists.You can also configure a default workflow in the metadata form in the respective teamroomtemplate. This workflow is run on creation AFTER starting the "normal" create event.The solution comes with a default template with the workflow sol.teamroom.teamroom.created.54 ELO TeamroomBy default, this workflow creates a feed post and sets the target permissions, which you canconfigure in the configuration interface.Teamroom repository In the Teamroom repository, you</s> 
<s>can configure the events as in the main repository.55 ELO TeamroomConditions and limitations As the documents and folders are linked based on their GUID, it is not yet possible to show adocument in different Teamrooms. This means you cannot create part of a teamroom as a separateadditional teamroom.Only main references can be synchronized. Additional references and links are ignored.As synchronization is the process of comparing the two repositories, make sure that the Teamroomis large enough to accommodate the synchronization interval. Synchronizing large Teamrooms atshort intervals can cause an excessively high load on the server.The following metadata fields are synchronized:All mapped fieldsShort nameExtra textMarkersVersion numberTypeDocument dateDocument statusFull text markerSort orderThe permissions (which are always taken from the parent directory of the target page) and ownerare not synchronized.All other metadata forms are undefined in terms of synchronization. This means that the status canchange from version to version depending on changes from live operation.For new document versions, the document file, the version number, and the version comments aretaken over.If there are multiple changes to the metadata or document files between syncs, only the currentstatus is synchronized. Not all interim states are created on the other end.If an object has undergone multiple complex changes (i.e. metadata changed, moved, deleted, newversion) and this is detected upon synchronization, not all changes may be transferred in onesingle sync. In some cases, you may have to run a second sync.On the Teamroom repository side, documents or folders must not be moved from one teamroom toanother, as this teamroom may be located on an entirely different server. On the main repositoryside, this is permitted â€“ in this case, the entry is deleted from the teamroom.As fields are mapped via the group name, no metadata forms are permitted that use the samegroup name multiple times.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 56 ELO TeamroomTo register users, the ELOwf service user for the Teamroom repository requires the Changepassword right.As soon as a feed entry has an ACL, nothing is transferred because the permissions on the otherside cannot be emulated. The user names of feed entries are inserted in plain text in thesynchronized repository. The service is entered as the user.The order of the feed items is not guaranteed to be the same on both sides of the main andTeamroom repositories.The date of a synchronized feed item is the date at the time of synchronization and not the datethe feed item was originally created.57 ELO Teamroom Table of contents How it works and architecture Overview Installation Introduction and requirements Requirements Install application in the main repository Install ELO Teamroom server Install scripts on the ELO Teamroom server Installation of the packages Restart and test Configuration on the ELO Teamroom server Teamroom configuration E-mail server configuration Edit config file in the main repository Install scripts in the main repository Restart and test Configuration in the main repository Create reference Modify metadata form assignment Configuration of connection data User assignment Users and groups Introduction Groups Teamroom Creators Teamroom Users ELO Users</s>

The PDF files are displayed in ELO clients as documentpreviews.Another task is to provide OCR for the ELO Indexserver.InformationELO Textreader (gen. 2) is a new product and replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr) starting with versionELO 21.4.Please noteTo allow ELO Textreader (gen. 2) to process documents containing special Microsoft fonts ina Linux operating system, you must install these fonts in advance. The installation processvaries according to the Linux distribution you are using. You can find more information aboutthis on the Internet if you search for the keyword ttf-mscorefonts.Architecture Standalone application ELO Textreader (gen. 2) starts as a standalone application and does not require a Tomcat server.The ELO Server Setup installs it as a service in the operating system. It can also be executed fromthe command line via Java code. You will find a corresponding shell script in the bin folder of thedownload package.Cluster capacity Multiple instances of ELO Textreader (gen. 2) can be clustered with a load balancer. The loadbalancer must ensure that requests for a specific conversion job reach the same instance, so youneed to configure it for sticky sessions. The ELO Indexserver assumes that the load balancerimplements sticky sessions with HTTP cookies. It remembers the cookies transmitted from theserver and sends them in all requests belonging to the conversion job.This is a configuration example of a load balancer with the Apache2 web server:3 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)The Apache2 modules proxy, proxy_http, proxy_balancer, and lbmethod_byrequests must beenabled.Supported file types The file types listed below can be processed by ELO Textreader (gen. 2).Full text processing File type Converter ID7z com.elo.tr2.conv.zip7zip com.elo.tr2.conv.zipai com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.psdbmp com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrcsv com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.exceldcx com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrdjv com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrdjvu com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrdoc com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.worddocx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.worddxl com.elo.tr2.conv.zipeml com.elo.tr2.conv.eml<VirtualHost localhost:80> ServerName loadbalancer Header add Set-Cookie "ROUTEID=.%{BALANCER_WORKER_ROUTE}e; path=/" env=BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED <Proxy balancer://cluster> BalancerMember http://server1:9060 route=TR1 BalancerMember http://server2:9050 route=TR2 ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests ProxySet stickysession=ROUTEID </Proxy> ProxyPass / balancer://cluster/ ProxyPassReverse / balancer://cluster/ LogLevel info CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access-loadbalancer.log combined ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error-loadbalancer.log</VirtualHost>4 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)File type Converter IDgif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrgz com.elo.tr2.conv.ziphtml com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordj2k com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjar com.elo.tr2.conv.zipjb2 com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjfif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjp2 com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpc com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpeg com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpg com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrmhtml com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordmsg com.elo.tr2.conv.msgodt com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordpcx com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrpdf com.elo.tr2.conv.pdfpng com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrppt com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.pptpptx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.pptrtf com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordtar com.elo.tr2.conv.ziptif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrtiff com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrvsd com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.visiovsdx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.visiowar com.elo.tr2.conv.zipxls com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.excelxlsx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.excelz com.elo.tr2.conv.zipzip com.elo.tr2.conv.zipPreview generation File type Converter IDai com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.psdbmp com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrcsv com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.exceldcx com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr5 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)File type Converter IDdjv com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrdjvu com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrdoc com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.worddocx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.worddxl com.elo.tr2.conv.zipeml com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.mailgif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrhtml com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordj2k com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjb2 com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjfif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjp2 com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpc com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpeg com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrjpg com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrmhtml com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordmsg com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.mailodt com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordpcx com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrpdf com.elo.tr2.conv.pdfpng com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrppt com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.pptpptx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.pptrtf com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.wordtif com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrtiff com.elo.tr2.conv.ocrvsd com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.visiovsdx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.visioxls com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.excelxlsx com.elo.tr2.conv.aspose.excel6 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)Configuration The configuration is done in a file consisting of name-value pairs called config.properties in theconfiguration directory of the ELO installation.ImportantOnly ELO Textreader (gen. 2) and the responsible administrators may access theconfiguration file.Resource requirements ELO Textreader (gen. 2) consumes significant CPU time and</s>

For more instructions, see the ELO Indexserver options page (in the ELOApplication Server, select /ix-<Name> > Login > Configure Options > Help).If multiple ELO Indexservers are active for the repository, they negotiate among themselves whichone will perform conversion. If only one specific ELO Indexserver is to be responsible for this, enterthe option value only for the instance name of this ELO Indexserver. However, this is onlyworthwhile if converting a large number of documents.

Additional information can only be viewed after logging on.Authentication for client application The value of this configuration entry should be left empty if a license key is available (new as ofELO 21.4). Otherwise, you need to enter *.The ELO Textreader (gen. 2) functions may only be used by ELO programs. This is due to licensingrequirements of several commercial components that are integrated in ELO Textreader. Especiallyin the case of cloud installations, you should pay attention to the license terms if an ELO Textreaderinstance is made publicly available to multiple clients on the Internet.This is why ELO Textreader (gen. 2) requires an authentication key in every request. If a license keyis stored in the ELO installation, the public part of the license key is transmitted as authentication.The public part of the key is checked when the request is sent to the ELO Indexserver on license.elo.com.For installations with a license file instead of a license key, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) must not bepublicly accessible. It is the responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that only ELOprograms can access the ELO Textreader, e.g. through an appropriate firewall configuration.Currently, only the ELO Indexserver requires access to the text reader.Map file extension to converter With the default settings, the converters provided in ELO Textreader (gen. 2) are already mapped toall file extensions that they can process.

Otherwise, the ELO Indexserver firstreceives a handle with which it repeatedly requests the text content at intervals of a few seconds.A preview file in PDF format is generated along with the full text content. The ELO Indexserverstores both these files in the repository along with the document.InformationA preview file is only generated for documents that have been added to the full text search.The ELO Indexserver also calls ELO Textreader (gen. 2) to process OCR tasks. Therefore, a separateconnection to the OCR service is not required.InformationUnlike the previous ELO Textreader, the connection is established by the ELO Indexserver.This allows you to use ELO Textreader (gen. 2) in different installations without having to listthe URLs of the ELO Indexservers in its configuration.Conversion for foreground and background tasks To prioritize conversion tasks triggered by user actions, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) manages separatetask pools for foreground and background tasks. In the configuration, you can specify the allocationof total resources to the two task pools. In addition, foreground tasks are executed with a higherpriority (Java thread priority) than the background tasks.The ELO Indexserver treats queries from the ELO Java Client, ELO Web Client, ELO Desktop Client,or the ELO apps for iOS and Android as foreground tasks. This currently only relates to OCR tasks.Service tasks (e.g. from ELO Automation Services) such as full text and preview processing, andOCR, are considered background tasks.15 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)Converter ELO Textreader (gen. 2) delegates tasks to internal converter modules, which are selectedaccording to document type and target type (text content or PDF preview). Temporary files may becreated in the working directory in the process. These are deleted after conversion.If the document being converted additionally contains documents (e.g. e-mails with attachments),there is a child folder for each of the contained documents. The conversion process is onlycompleted when all contained documents have been converted. Afterwards, the result can beretrieved from the ELO Indexserver.Logging With the default settings, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) writes three log files:tr2.log: Log of processing stepstr2-ocr.log: Log of OCR processingtr2-report.log: For each conversion job, one line with information about success or errorThe log outputs are configured in the logback.xml file of the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) configurationdirectory. You will find information on the file syntax</s> 
<s>here.Every time ELO Textreader (Gen. 2) is called, it sends unique call tags that identify all associatedactions. Extract from tr2.log:In this example, the call identifier IX1-1355106364585954729 is transmitted for the HTTP request. Itconsists of the instance name of the ELO Indexserver IX1 and the random number 1355106364585954729.

An ELO Indexserver must already beinstalled for the repository, but not necessarily on the same computer/server. Only a rudimentarilyconfigured ELO XML Importer is installed, the configuration of which is located in the config.xml file(in the installation directory, e.g.Â ELOenterprise\config\im-<Name of repository>) and not in thedatabase. In contrast to other modules, the ELO XML Importer is not configured in the ELOAdministration Console. If multiple import directories or multiple XML importers are required at thesame time, you will have to edit the config.xml file. If not, you can skip the following chapter.ELO XML Importer version 20.00.001.001 and higher use Logback for logging (older versions use Log4j). From this version on, a logback.xml file is required for configuring logging (provided by thesetup, only has to be created in case of manual installation).Please noteWith ELO XML Importer version 20.00.001.001 and higher, if you install the modulemanually, you have to provide for a logback.xml file.Example logback.xml file:You can either change the log level as the root level in the logback.xml file or on the ELO XMLImporter status screen (in Edit mode):<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><configuration> <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"> <file>c:/temp/logs/im-elo20.log</file> <append>true</append> <encoder> <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-60(%thread %X{NDC} %-5level \(%logger{0}.java:%L\)) - %msg%n </encoder> </appender> <root level="info"> <appender-ref ref="FILE"/> </root></configuration>3 ELO XML Importer4 ELO XML ImporterStructure of config.xml Excerpt from the config.xml file (example for an ELO XML Importer):The parameters in the configuration file consist of a combined parameter name (key) and aparameter value.

The document date, on the other hand,remains empty. The xdate field may also contain a time inaddition to the date in the format YYYYMMDDHHMM or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. The times will be adjusted for the time zone ofthe server.Xdate with attribute <mode="current">: The current date isentered to the document date. Complete the date fields with anISO date (YYYYMMDD), entering a four-digit number for the year.The idate field may contain a time in addition to the date(YYYYMMDDHHMMSS). Note that the seconds must be entered, eventhough they will not be saved (you can simply enter a fixednumber of 00).typeMetadataformThe value attribute cannot be left empty, as it contains either thenumber of the metadata form or its name. Default values of themetadata form are applied.dtypeDocumenttypeYou can define an object as various document types by using avalue from 254 to 310. You can also create additional structureelements here. These can be assigned values from 1 to 253 andmust not have a document entry (from ELO 10, this check isomitted).access KeyThe name attribute contains the name. If a name cannot beassigned upon import, it is ignored. The type attribute cancontain an r (read access), w (write access), d (delete), e (editdocument), l (edit lists), p (set permissions, from version 21,20.00.003.001 and 12.00.004.000, not in ELO 11 and ELO 10), or acombination of these five characters. AND group: AND groupscan be defined with the subgroup attribute. Separate multiplegroups with a semicolon ";".aclAll keys (<access>) are located in the <acl> tag. The <acl> tagcan additionally contain the attribute mode="new". This attributeshows that all existing document rights (keys) will be deletedfrom the metadata form and only the new ones from the XMLcontrol file will be entered. Assigned permissions apply only todocuments, not to folders.memo Extra textIf the extra text contains explicit line breaks, these must bespecified with \n or \r\n. Line breaks from the XML source are notapplied to the ELO entry.markerColormarkingThis indicates the color marking for the logical document entry.Only the marker number, not its name, can be entered here.9 ELO XML ImporterDay ELO field Explanation (see example above)sregVersionnumberDefines which current version number will be displayed in themetadata dialog box with a maximum of eight characters.

The first filing location automatically becomes themain entry in ELO; all additional locations are references (see Note under the table). If a filing location is defined using theformat Â¶folder1Â¶folder2Â¶etc., the importer creates folders asneeded. As the destination value has to be in square brackets,which in this context are syntactic symbols, both have to bemasked with a backslash (\) in folder names with squarebrackets. Optionally, the filing path can also be entered in theindex notation of the ELO client in order to automaticallygenerate it from the metadata or via the document ID. In thiscase, the filing location must already exist. With the typeattribute, you can define the metadata form for newly createdfolders. If this parameter is missing, the Folder metadata form isused. Example: <destination type="Invoice" value=" [â€¦] +LA"/> (for description of placeholders LA, LK, etc., see Note).index index fieldThe name attribute contains either the number of the index field(1 to 51) or the group name of the index field. Since the latter isnot necessarily unique (as a group entry can occur multipletimes), choose the numerical form in these cases. If the groupname is ELO_FNAME, the value is entered to the 51st index field(row for the file name).structureAdditionalfoldersThe value attribute contains a filing location that is createdempty if it does not yet exist. In contrast to the destination tag,no reference is created to the document here; the target remainsempty. With this structure tag, you can ensure that whencreating a folder, a complete folder structure is created (eventhose that will not be filled through this import â€“ see Note). Youshould use this function sparingly, since every structure pathmust be checked to determine it exists every time a filingprocess is initiated. Depending on the folder structure, this canhave a significant impact on performance. With the typeattribute, you can define the metadata form for newly createdfolders. If this parameter is missing, the Folder metadata form isused. As the structure value has to be in square brackets, whichin this context are syntactic symbols, both have to be maskedwith a backslash (\) in folder names with square brackets.versions-comment Comment Version comment11 ELO XML ImporterDay ELO field Explanation (see example above)docfileDocumentfileThe name attribute contains the file name of the object. It canremain empty, which creates a document without a documentfile. If a name is entered without a path, this will refer to thedirectory that contains the XML file. Every document mustcontain its own document file. If multiple documents</s> 
<s>existcompressed within a file, first, these must be unpacked in anextra pass before the XML file is transferred to ELO. The filename is saved in the version comment of the DocHistory table.sigfileSignaturefileWith this optional entry, the newly created document is given asignature immediately. The signature file must be created usingthe ELO signature components. A signature file can only bespecified if a document file exists.attfile AttachmentUsing this optional entry, the new document is created with anattachment. An attachment can only be specified when adocument file exists.path Filing pathThe number of the filing path when filing a new document. If thisfield is missing, the preset from the form definition will be used.If no value is entered there, the current default filing path isselected. Please note: If an invalid value is specified, thedocument cannot be filed.replReplicationsetsNormally, an XML entry inherits the replication set list from thetarget folder. However, if you want to file the document to thechaos folder, or set up custom replication sets for thedocuments, you can use this tag to specify replication sets. Thelist contains comma-separated 32-bit integer values that resultin a bit vector for the desired sets.encryptionEncryptionkeyName of the encryption key. When using an ELO Indexserver witha main release older than 12, the password for the encryptionkey was entered in the config.xml. Starting with version 12, theconcept of extended encryption keys from ELOÂ 12 has beenimplemented. Only encryption keys with standard security whichhave a user part and a system part with a separate systempassword are supported (see also the chapter Encryption in the ELO administration documentation). The encryption keyinformation from the configuration file is no longer read.workflowSelect an existing workflow with the template attribute. The nameattribute sets the name of the workflow that is started.Note The following placeholders can be used for the filing paths (destination and structure tags):LA: The filing date is applied to the filing path (idate).

As soon as adata stream is detected, the XML file is read, the required structural elements are created in therepository, and the documents are filed. The server decides whether a new stream is availablebased on the exclusive availability of the XML file. A data stream can be created as follows:The source creates an XML file.For each document, the document file is copied to the target directory and a corresponding <obj>entry is added to the XML file.The XML file closes.After the source has closed the XML file, ELO can start its processing.Alternatively, the source can construct the XML file using a different extension than .xml (suchÂ as .$$$). The source application renames the file to .xml when the process is complete and the file hasbeen closed. This method is normally the most reliable, but it requires the source to be able toperform renaming.If the source does not keep the XML file open permanently and renaming is not possible, you canalternatively set ELO to not recognize the completion of the action according to its unrestrictedavailability, but rather according to an additional control file.The source creates the XML file xyz.xml.The documents are written.The XML file closes.The signal file xyz.sig is created (empty).ELO starts processing as soon as the signal file exists.<destlist> <destination value="[Â¶Invoice managementÂ¶Invoices_]+LD"/> <destination value="[Â¶Invoice managementÂ¶\[Smith\]]"/></destlist>14 ELO XML ImporterThe HTML status page in the browser presents another option for starting the import process. Clickthe link Import now to start processing manually. This will also refresh the cache of thecorresponding server, which is useful if, forÂ example, the configuration has been changed via theELO client in the meantime (new metadata form, user, etc.).Column index In ELO, it is possible to store multiple values to an index field, which is called a column index. Thisformat is then useful when a range of equivalent data is available for an entry (suchÂ as a list oforder numbers for a document named Invoice). It is very easy to use this column index entry in theXML control file. If multiple <index> entries with the same name attribute exist within the <indexlist>, they are automatically combined into a column index.Example: Index field 1 contains the order numbers for an invoice; the numbers 123, 140, and 210have been entered. The section of the XML file will then look like this:The index entries here can be placed in any order you wish; they do not need to be sorted. Notethat an entry with the format <index name="1" value="123,140,219"/> generates a completelydifferent result. This creates a single large entry instead of a column index. With an entry in thisformat, it is not possible to efficiently search for order number 140 over the SQL server.Creating a structure The required filing structure is automatically created according to the <destination> and <structure></s> 
<s>tags as needed. Here you will only have limited influence on the metadata and theform type of the elements created. However, there is a possibility to explicitly create the structureusing custom <obj> entries. You will then have complete influence on the object parameters and themetadata assignment. To prevent the folder from being created again each time, and in the processincorrectly creating multiple instances of it, the <obj> entry must be marked as checked, which isdone via the mode attribute pass (<obj mode="check").An example of creating a structure:<indexlist><index name="1" value="123"/><index name="1" value="140"/><index name="1" value="210"/></indexlist><?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><eloobjlist ver="1.0"> <obj mode="check"> <desc value="Folder99"/> <xdate value="20041011"/> <type value ="Development project"/> <dtype value="2"/>15 ELO XML ImporterThis example will first check whether a folder with the name Folder99 already exists in the XMLDocs folder. If so, the <obj> entry will be ignored. Otherwise, this folder will now be created withthe information from the XML control file, where you will have great influence over the basicparameters (e.g.Â metadata form or date entries) and the metadata. If the XML Docs folder in thisexample does not yet exist, it will also be created automatically.Please noteIn update mode/when importing ESW files, at least one document has to be imported tocreate structures using <structure> tags. When importing XML files, the <structure> tag canalso be used without specifying a file for import.Creating receipt files Entry toconfig.xmlExplanationConfirmDirHere, you enter the directory to which receipt files will be written. This entrymust not have a \ at the end (as is the case for all directory entries in the XMLprofiles), suchÂ as E:\ELOenterprise\confirm.ConfirmExt File extension for the receipt files (.QIT)ConfirmOkText in the receipt file for documents correctly filed. You can use the followingplaceholders here:%ID%: outputs the object ID of the new entry.%GUID%: outputs the GUID of the new entry.%DESC%: outputs the short name of the new entry.%IX:nn%: outputs the index field nn (starting with 0).ConfirmDelOkText in the receipt file for "documents correctly deleted". You can enter thesame placeholders as for ConfirmOk.Example:<entry key="import1_ConfirmDelOK">OK: Document %DESC% with PK: %IX:01%,%IX:01% deleted. guid:%GUID%</entry>ConfirmErr Text in the receipt file for Error filing.ConfirmStructure If true, receipt file for folders. <indexlist> <index name="EWP_TYP" value="Test project 2"/> </indexlist> <destlist> <destination type="Development" value="[Â¶XML Docs]"/> </destlist> </obj></eloobjlist >16 ELO XML ImporterEntry toconfig.xmlExplanationConfirmEmpty If true, empty receipt files are also written.By using the entries ConfirmDir, ConfirmExt, ConfirmOk, ConfirmErr, ConfirmStructure, and ConfirmEmpty, receipt files can be created for the imported data sets, or for the deleted data setsvia ConfirmDelOk. The receipt file will be assigned the same name as the XML control file with thefile extension defined under ConfirmExt. A line is written to the receipt file for each document entryin the XML control file, containing the text set in either ConfirmOk or ConfirmErr.EXCEPTION: If the option is selected to check whether the documents exist and a new document orfolder is not created because of it, nothing will be written to the receipt file either. Generating anempty receipt file can be set as an option in the config.xml file. If the XML structure of the input fileis</s> 
<s>incomplete or damaged, processing may halt before the end of the document. If this occurs,fewer lines will be written to the receipt file than are blocks in the XML control file.17 ELO XML ImporterAutomatic metadata update The bulk import service can also be implemented for automatic metadata comparisons.Documents are filed to ELO with minimal metadata (such as aÂ barcode). From an application, anXML file will then be created with the complete metadata. The service automatically adds to themetadata. The format of the XML file here will essentially be identical to that of the import file.Differences between the individual tags TagName inimportdata setExplanationeloupdatelist eloobjlistThis difference enables the service to differentiate between both typesof lists.<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><eloupdatelist ver="1.0"> <obj> <source value="â€¦"/> <desc value="â€¦"/> <idate value="â€¦"/> <xdate value="â€¦"/> <acl> <access type="â€¦" name="â€¦" /> â€¦ </acl> <memo>â€¦</memo> <indexlist> <index name="â€¦" value="â€¦"/> â€¦ </indexlist> <destlist> <destination value="â€¦"/> â€¦ </destlist> <workflowlist> <workflow template="..." name="..."/> </workflowlist> <docfile name="..."/> </obj> â€¦</eloupdatelist>18 ELO XML ImporterTagName inimportdata setExplanationobj objmode attribute: The value versioning can be entered here. Thedocument will then be created if it does not yet exist.source./. notavailableWith this field, the existing ELO entry with minimal metadata will beaddressed. This can be the internal ELO ObjectId (#1234 means ObjectId1234) or a GUID, which also needs to be preceded by a "#", e.g.Â #(B66B68360A-87F4-4AC6-874A-9FE92DF9E6). However, it can also be afiling path with the format [Â¶sord1Â¶sord2â€¦]. It can also be one or moreindex fields, e.g.Â "BARCODE=1234567;REGNR=C2Z68", if the entry with thecode 1234567 and the entry REGNR with the code C2Z68 are to beselected via the index field BARCODE (you need to specify the groupname and not the field name). If the document meant to be updatedcannot be uniquely identified, an error document is generated.desc descIf the value attribute of this tag remains empty, the short name will beretained automatically from the existing record.idate, xdate idate, xdateIf the value attribute of this tag remains empty, the date informationwill be retained automatically from the existing record.index indexThe index tag can also contain a mode attribute. If this is set to thevalue new, this entry will overwrite all existing entries in this indexfield. If this is not set, new index values will be added to the existingones in column index format.destlist destlistThe destlist can remain empty, which will keep the entry in itsoriginal location in the repository. If the destlist is not empty, thedocument is moved from its original filing location to the first entry inthe list. As the destination value has to be in square brackets, whichin this context are syntactic symbols, both have to be masked with abackslash (\) in folder names with square brackets. References will becreated for all additional list entries. The first entry can also simply befilled with a "*". In this case, the document will remain at its originallocation and the additional references will be created (see Examplesfor metadata update with "destlist").docfile docfileIf a docfile is specified in this update data set, it will be attached as anew version to the logical document.attfile attfileIf attfile is specified</s> 
<s>in this update data set, it will be attached as anew version of a document's attachment.aclAll keys (<access>) are located in the <acl> tag. The <acl> tag canadditionally contain the attribute mode="new". This attribute indicatesthat all existing keys have been deleted and only the new ones will besaved.19 ELO XML ImporterTagName inimportdata setExplanationdtypeDocumenttypeHere you can change the document type (values 254 to 310) and thetype of folder (values 1 to 253) (from ELO 10, the check to verifywhether the values lie in the range 1 to 253 is omitted). Warning: Nocheck as to whether you are changing a document or folder takes placehere. For this reason, please take special care to set correct values inthe control file.arcmodeDocumentstatus(filingmode)If the document has been filed with the status Non-modifiable(previously no changes possible, read-only), the document statuscannot be changed again.map<map> can contain an attribute mode="new". This will delete the old mapand create a new one.Structure FolderIn update mode, at least one document has to be imported (includingwhen importing ESW files). As the structure value has to be in squarebrackets, which in this context are syntactic symbols, both have to bemasked with a backslash (\) in folder names with square brackets.All other tags will be used as in the import data set.Examples for metadata update with "destlist" Example 1A metadata update should be carried out in ELO where additional references for the originaldocument Jacques in the folder Notes//Journaling//Administrator//DESKTOP-UUH4S35@DESKTOP-UUH4S35/16022021 are created in the folder Invoice Management//Smith.

The documents andfolders are entered to a deletelist and deleted by the ELO XML Importer. The format of the XML filehere will essentially be identical to that of the import or update control file, but only the ELO objectIDs or GUIDs have to be entered.Example delete control file:The objects to be deleted are addressed via an entry in the source field. The entry can be aninternal ELO object ID (#1234 means object</s>

This chapter is short andhelps experienced ELO users get started quickly.Possible actions and other elements The remaining chapters address possible actions and other elements of ELO Learning.Target audience This documentation is addressed to Business Solution ELO Learning users who manage courses.Separate documentation is available for administrators on the ELO SupportWeb.The scope of functions presented in this documentation may differ greatly from those in yourclient.If you do not find functions described in this documentation in your client, you do not havepermission to perform the action.3 Business Solution ELO LearningBasics Basic principle Business Solution ELO Learning assists you in managing and booking courses.ELO Learning consists of two components:Course administration: Courses are managed in the ELO client. You can create courses,sessions, and participants here and get an overview of available courses on the dashboard.Learning platform: Participants can enroll in and attend courses on the corresponding learningplatform.If ELO Learning is used together with ELO Knowledge, individual courses can be linked to spaces inorder to allow discussions among the participants.Different categories of courses are available:Online: This category includes:Virtual classrooms: These courses are attended via the optional integration withprovider GoToWebinar.E-learning coursesVideosFace-to-face: The course is carried out on site, and not on the learning platform.Course enrollment: Depending on the settings, courses can either be booked on the learningplatform, or participants are enrolled by the course administrator.You can create individual courses or learning paths, which are made up individual related courses.Once participants have successfully completed courses, certificates can be created automatically.General note ELO Learning works with the following clients:ELO Web ClientELO Java ClientELO Desktop ClientInformationIn this documentation, we use screenshots from the ELO Web Client.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â—¦ â—¦ â—¦ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 4 Business Solution ELO Learninghttps://docs.elo.com/solutions/knowledge/en-us/elo-business-solutions-knowledge/https://docs.elo.com/solutions/knowledge/en-us/elo-business-solutions-knowledge/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-java-client/en-us/elo-java-client/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-java-client/en-us/elo-java-client/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-desktop-client/en-us/elo-desktop-client/https://docs-nightly.elo.dev/user/elo-desktop-client/en-us/elo-desktop-client/Requirements Your administrator must have configured ELO Learning for you.Program interface Fig.: Business Solution ELO Learning program interfaceYou will find ELO Learning functions in the following areas:1 'Learning' group on the 'New' ribbon tabYou can create new courses via the Learning group.

<s>ELO Dropzone | ELO DropzoneELO DropzoneELO DropzoneTable of contentsIntroduction Basics Usage examples Administration 2 ELO DropzoneIntroduction Structure The goal of this documentation is to explain the functions of ELO Dropzone.Introduction The first chapter contains the copyright notices, as well as general information about using themanual and an overview of the chapter content.Basics This chapter offers important information on installing and configuring ELO Dropzone.Usage examples This chapter contains usage examples which should help familiarize you with ELO Dropzone.Administration This chapter is aimed at administrators. It includes information on configuring and managing ELODropzone.3 ELO DropzoneBasics Overview ELO Dropzone makes it easier for you to file incoming documents to ELO. Simply drag documentsand files to a defined tile. ELO Dropzone enters the corresponding metadata and files yourdocuments based on your own rules. This provides you with easy access to frequently usedfunctions and enables you to file documents more easily to ELO. A database connection allows forinterfaces to programs, such as ERP systems. You can then use this data for metadata, forexample.You can set up filing tiles, search tiles, script tiles, and template tiles. With a search tile, you canconfigure the desired search terms via the metadata fields of a metadata form. It is also possible todefine search tiles that you can activate using keyboard shortcuts. With a script tile, you can call ascript event-controlled. With a template tile, you can create documents from templates in ELODropzone.You can also create additional variables with regular expressions in ELO Dropzone that can be usedto define tiles.General note The program works with the following clients:ELO Java ClientELOofficeThe function descriptions and screenshots in this manual were created using the ELO Java Client.The following ELO Dropzone functions are not available with ELOoffice:Edit groupsLoad tile from collectionPerform database searchCreate template tileCreate e-mailsAutomatic document check-inExtract data from barcodesInstallation and configuration Installation ELO Dropzone is a core part of the client and as such it is installed automatically together with theELO Java Client and ELOoffice.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 4 ELO DropzoneStart ELO Dropzone is started in different ways depending on the client.Starting ELO Dropzone with the ELO Java Client After installation with the ELO Java Client, a shortcut to ELO Dropzone is placed on the desktop.Double-click the ELO Dropzone icon.The ELO Java Client logon dialog box opens.Log on with your user name.ELO Dropzone and the ELO Java Client open.Start-up with ELOoffice After installation, a shortcut to ELOoffice is placed on the desktop.ELO Dropzone starts automatically with ELOoffice.Disable: You can disable ELO Dropzone in the configuration.ELO menu > Configuration > General > Additional modules.Uncheck the box next to ELO Dropzone.ELO Dropzone will no longer start automatically when you open the client.5 ELO DropzoneProgram interface Example ELO Dropzone program interface with display groups and tiles.Collapse/expand You can expand or collapse ELO Dropzone by clicking the header with the ELO Dropzone text.

The change will take effect once you restart ELO Dropzone.InformationRefer to the Administration chapter to learn how to make changes to the configuration viathe extra text of the metadata form.Configure display groups You can form groups for each work area. This helps you structure ELO Dropzone, as the tiles arespread across different display groups. Areas are defined by the administrator. Individual users candynamically determine which groups they'd like to see. It is also possible to move individual tilesbetween work areas. You can also access the database directly via the individual display groups.Information from the selected database can then be used for the metadata. If you have createdcustom groups and already defined tiles, you have to explicitly add the existing tiles to yourgroups. The first display group should always be called Start. All tiles that are not assigned to a10 ELO Dropzonedisplay group are automatically added to the Start group. As no database query is necessary in the Start display group, you can leave the other fields blank.Open the Configure display groups dialog box from the ELO Dropzone context menu.

If youuse the same database as ELO, you can leave the field blank and do not have to configure anythingfor ELOix.11 ELO DropzoneInformationPlease read the ELO Indexserver Programming Guide for more information. The Access toexternal databases chapter describes in detail how to set up a database connection pool onthe application server.SQL query: Formulate an SQL query in this field. In the example above (see figure), the Microsoftsample database (Northwind) is accessed. You should know what tables and column names exist inthe selected SQL database. Select the columns you want to use as variables in the return. You canprepare and test the SQL query in a tool of your choice, for example SQL Server ManagementStudio. Once the query returns the desired results in the tool, you can replace the query text with aplaceholder for user input. The placeholder is:Filter field beside SQL query: If the database query works properly, you can test the SQL statementvia this filter field. The first selected data set is entered to the Return table. This allows you toconfigure the return step by step. You can define an identifier for the return for each selected dataset.Return: Define the variable in the the Identifier column per number. In the Identifier column, double-click the field you'd like to change. Complete your entry by pressing the ENTER key. If you clickelsewhere, your input will be discarded. With the arrow keys, you can navigate between fields andactivate the desired field by pressing the ENTER key in order to edit it. You can transform anycolumns of the database into variables. Ideally, you can configure the variables using the filter field(see above). Choose variable names that clearly indicate where the variables come from. Theresult is a better structured group, helping you to prevent errors in assigning variables to metadatafields in the tile definition.Display: Configure what is displayed and how. You can drag the defined variables from the Returnfield to the desired position in the Display field. You can also enter fixed texts.

You see the existing variables inthe Available variables area.Load a sample document via the Load button to import additional variables. For example, ifyou load a Word document, Word opens briefly to analyze the document. ELO Dropzone thenadds the detected metadata to the list of available variables.In addition to the method described above, there is a more effective method of readingmetadata. When you are in edit mode, you can drag and drop the file to the desired tile. Thetile configuration menu opens automatically. You now find metadata variables for the file inthe corresponding tabs. The number of variables you can choose from depends on the filetype.You can add metadata using the form fields in Microsoft Word, for example. In the form fieldproperties, you can enter a value to the Text box field. Afterwards, you can select thisvariable from the list in the tile configuration with the syntax Word.\<form field name>.It is also possible to read header data in Microsoft Word documents. Once you have draggedthe document containing headers to a tile, the variable Header.x shows up in the list ofavailable variables.22 ELO DropzoneNow assign or drag and drop the available variables or fixed text to the fields of the selectedmetadata form.The variables are displayed in the fields in curly brackets. This information means that everytime a document is processed using this tile, ELO immediately recognizes which data toread.InformationYou can also drag multiple variables to one field with this method.You can also read just parts of metadata, such as the first three letters of a first or last name. To dothis, enter the position of the first letter to be read and the number of letters to be read after thedata inside the curly bracket. For example, entering {All.Author(1,3)} only reads the first threeletters starting from the first character.Target Click</s>

Accordingly, the shortname would be Grp.0, the date would be Grp.1, the third field would be Grp.2 and so on.Other available variables include Clipboard.ALL for reading the Clipboard or Date.ThisMonthfor the month of filing.If you want to define a second filing target as a reference, separate the first and seconddefinition with a pipe symbol ("|").If the pipe symbol occurs in the path definition, you can separate the reference paths withthe Unicode character "â€¼". When this character appears in the path definition, it is used as theseparator and the pipe symbol is ignored.If you have not created any reference paths and you still want to permit the pipe symbol inthe text, insert the "!!" character at the end. This generates an empty reference path that isignored.Here is an example of a target path with a multiple filing definition:Â¶OrdersÂ¶{Date.This.Year}Â¶{Date.ThisMonth}|OrdersÂ¶{Grp.2(1,1)}Â¶{Grp.2}Alternative: Clicking Apply path uses the path selected in ELO as the filing target.You see all the Available variables on the right-hand side.

<s>Dropzone.Activate a tile from another application Tiles can be activated via the OLE interface of the ELO Java Client or via an elodms link.You can download and import a file from an e-mail message or a website in ELO. You only need toenter an appropriately formatted elodms URL to do this. In this case, the elodms link always startswith the following parameters:elodms://dz/\<tile name\>|The URL can either contain a file name or an HTTP address. If you use a file name, it must bevisible locally on the client computer. The file name is then added to the elodms link with URLencoding.Example: elodms://dz/Rechnung|c:\rechnung.tifIf you use an HTTP download address, you have to add the identifier http, followed by a pipesymbol and the extension (such as PDF). This is followed by another pipe symbol and then thedownload address. This part must be URL-encoded for a valid link to result.Example: elodms://dz/Report|http|pdf|www.forum.elo.com%2Fscript%2FAddNoteConfirmFlow.pdfYou can, for example, send this elodms URL as an e-mail attachment. When the recipient of this e-mail clicks the link, the file is downloaded and transferred to the tile specified â€“ as if you haddragged it to the tile.67 ELO DropzoneUsage examples In the following, you will find examples of use for the previously defined tiles.Using filing tiles Information You want to file a document using ELO Dropzone.File document Drag a document to the desired filing tile.For example, if you drag a Word document to a filing tile, Microsoft Word opens briefly to analyzethe document.The document is filed to ELO if all required fields were recognized.68 ELO DropzoneThe check mark indicates that the document was filed to ELO.InformationIf you file multiple documents at once using a tile, the number of successfully importeddocuments is shown next to the check mark.Alternative: The metadata form opens if not all required fields were recognized. Once you havecompleted the mandatory fields and clicked OK to confirm, the document is filed to ELO.InformationClick a tile to open ELO to the last document filed with that tile.Using search tiles Information The following describes how to start the search dialog box of the client with the help of an ELODropzone search tile.69 ELO DropzoneTriggering a search via the search tile You have configured a search tile in ELO Dropzone as described in the Setting up a search tilesection.

<s>result is displayed in the client.Copy with CTRL+CSelect a search term in any application with machine-readable text (e.g.Â Microsoft Word, PDFreader, browser, etc.).Enter the desired keyboard shortcut that you defined for Copy with CTRL+C in the search tile.ELO Dropzone simulates copying with CTRL+C. The search result is displayed in the client.Copy with double-clickPoint to a search term in any application with machine-readable text (e.g.Â Microsoft Word,PDF reader, browser, etc.).Enter the desired keyboard shortcut that you defined for Copy with double-click in the searchtile.ELO Dropzone simulates a double-click. The word is selected and applied as a search term. Thesearch result is displayed in the client.OCR window contentsOpen a file containing OCR-readable text, such as a scanned document in TIFF format.Enter the desired keyboard shortcut that you defined for OCR window contents in the searchtile.ELO Dropzone evaluates the OCR window contents and uses it as a search term. The search resultis displayed in the client.71 ELO DropzoneSearch for customer name via customer number Information In this example, we will link the following functions: hotkey (activation via keyboard shortcut),reading the window title, database query, and search. A program shows the current customernumber in the window title. You want to use this number to perform a search via keyboard shortcutin ELO. You will use the customer number to search for the customer name. This requires anupstream database query. Our example uses the ELO user list as a "customer database".Step by step To capture the customer number from the window title, you need a regular expression. Ourexample assumes that the window title contains the text USER-, followed by the user ID,Â e.g. USER-3.Open the Regular expressions dialog box via the context menu.Click New to create a new regular expression.In the Name field, select Title from the drop-down menu to show the window title.Enter the name UserId.In the Reg.Ex. field, enter the following regular expression: USER-(\d*).The result appears.Save the regular expression.The regular expression is listed under Available expressions as Title.UserId.Querying the customer data for the customer number requires a group. The SQL query forconverting the user ID into the user name is configured in the group, and the variable name"ID.name" is defined for the user name.In the context menu, click Edit groups to open the Configure display groups dialog box.Click the plus icon to create a new display group named UserId and enter the SQL query asshown in the figure below.72 ELO DropzoneIn the Return area, you will see how the SQL query converts the user ID to the user name anddefined the variable name "ID.name".Save the display group.In the UserId display group, create a new search tile via the context menu in editing modeand configure it like you would a standard search tile.On the Activation tab, define a keyboard shortcut in the Activation via keyboard shortcutfield. Select Only activate from the drop-down menu.73 ELO DropzoneEnter the variable "ID.name" to the Short name field on the Fields tab.On the Target tab, enter the variable "Title.UserId" to the Database search field and save thetile configuration.74 ELO DropzoneThe</s> 
<s>database search is performed correctly, and the manual input is not evaluated.Generating an e-mail from a customer number Information We want to determine the customer number from the window title using a regular expression. Wewant to generate an e-mail with the recipient address filled out via a search tile with configuredkeyboard shortcut and database query.Step by step This template tile is created in the same group as in the previous example and thus uses theexisting database query and regular expression for identifying the customer number in the windowtitle.Follow steps 1-9 from the Search for customer name via customer number example.In the UserId display group, create a new template tile via the context menu in editing mode.75 ELO DropzoneOn the View tab, select the UserId group and the 'Create Outlook e-mail target.3. 76 ELO DropzoneOn the Activation tab, select the keyboard shortcut. Select Only activate from the drop-downmenu of Activation via keyboard shortcut and enter the desired keyboard shortcut.77 ELO DropzoneOn the Fields tab, complete the Short name, Recipient, and Message fields as shown in thefollowing figure.78 ELO DropzoneThe text from the short name is entered to the e-mail subject. The recipient is entered to the"To" field in the e-mail. The body of the e-mail is generated from the message. All fields canuse the variables from the database query (ID.*) or other sources.On the Target tab, enter the variable "Title.UserId" to the Database search field and save thetile configuration.79 ELO DropzoneEntering the set keyboard shortcut for this template tile generates an e-mail with thecustomer data.80 ELO DropzoneAdministration Dropzone Administration folder The module automatically creates a folder named Dropzone within the Administration folder inELO. The information is stored there as text files, which you can export individually or as entirefolders to other repositories. The Dropzone folder contains the following child entries:Global: All global tiles are saved in this folder. These tiles are available for all users. Ingeneral, an administrator can create multiple global folders and make them visible todifferent user groups via ELO permissions. Since all folders have to have the name Global, itis recommended to assign the folders color markers for a better overview. We recommendcontrolling the creation of multiple global folders with user IDs (see below).Store (ELO Java Client): The tile definitions for the tile collection are saved to this folder. Thetile collection is split into multiple areas. The administrator can determine these areas byadding the desired area folders below the Store folder. The administrator can determine viathe permissions of the area folders which users can add tiles to this area of the collectionand which areas are visible to the user.User.<User-ID>: The personal tile definitions of each user are saved in this folder. Inaddition, the ELO Dropzone configuration is saved in the extra text of the user folder. If youwant to specify a different name for the global folder, for example to assign specific usergroups a selection of multiple global folders, enter Global=\<other folder name> to the extratext.InformationThe settings in these folders are stored as text files which you can</s> 
<s>export individually or asentire folders to other repositories.â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 81 ELO DropzonePlease noteIn order to file documents via ELO Dropzone, the Dropzone folder must be stored in theAdministration folder. If not, add the folder manually.Useful access restrictions For ELO Dropzone to find the basic folder, the Dropzone users must have at least View (R) objectpermission to the folder. As ELO Dropzone automatically creates user folders that do not exist yet,the users should also have Edit lists (L) permissions.A user requires at least read access to their ELO Dropzone folder. When this permission is revoked,ELO Dropzone assumes that no user folder was created yet and creates it again. It also makessense for the user to have Edit lists (L) permissions so that new tiles can be saved there. If youremove this permission, the Indexserver prevents users from saving new tiles. However, as ELO82 ELO DropzoneDropzone doesn't expect the permission to be revoked for the user, this may result in an errormessage.Permission for the tile collection Users only need read access to the store folder. Only administrators that can add new categoriesneed Edit lists (L) permissions. In general, you should, however, give these users full access to thefolder so that existing entries can be edited or deleted.The administrator can determine via the permissions to the category which categories a user cansee and therefore import tiles from this category. Furthermore, the administrator can define via Editlists (L) permissions which users can export their own tiles into the tile collection.In the example, all users have read permission to all categories. However, they only have Expandcontent permissions for the first two categories. If users want to share a tile, they are only offeredthese two categories as the destination.The Load tile from collection function offers all four categories as the user has the read permissionfor all of them.Configuring ELO Dropzone Make general settings for all ELO Dropzone tiles via System settings in the context menu (see Installation and configuration chapter). Alternatively, you can enter configuration settings for ELODropzone in the Administration folder of the repository. You can also configure additional settingshere that are not available in the System settings dialog box.83 ELO DropzoneOpen the ELO Dropzone folder under the Administration folder in your Client.// Administration // Dropzone // Global for global settings// Administration // Dropzone // User.<User-ID> for personal settingsOpen the metadata form for the folder and switch to the Extra text tab, then enter variousparameters there.Start ELO Dropzone minimized: In the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: start=minimized. By default, ELO Dropzone starts expanded; the parameter for this is: start=normal.Select an animation mode: In the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: animation=<setting>. 0, 6, and 8 are possible values for this setting. If 0, ELO Dropzone determinesan appropriate animation mode when maximizing or minimizing its display. If 6, the size iscontinually recalculated during the animation. If 8, there is no animation and the windowimmediately switches from expanded to collapsed, or vice versa.PDF printer output directory: In</s> 
<s>the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: Printer.Dir=<PDF printer directory>. This parameter specifies the PDF printer output directory. Itdoes not need to use the ELO PDF printer. Any source for PDF files is allowed.PDF and TIFF file OCR evaluation: Open the Extra text tab in the metadata form and enter: maxfulltextpages=<setting>. Use this parameter to determine the maximum number of pages perdocument to be processed during OCR preprocessing. Recommended setting: ten pages.Regular expressions: The administrator can store multiple regular expressions for metadatadetection. The regular expressions can be used for the recognition of window titles or file paths andcan analyze them. The definitions of regular expressions are saved to the Extra text of the Globalfolder. Each line in the Extra text contains a definition. The definition is made up of differentcomponents: first the name of the variable to be used later on, then an equal sign followed by theregular expression itself.InformationTo comment out a line, enter a # in front of it.Restoring deleted tiles You can restore deleted tiles in two steps. In the ELO client, click Organize > Delete > Show deletedentries. The tile configuration folder reappears in the Administration folder, but it will be shown insquare brackets, meaning it is not currently active. Click Restore in the same group. Result: Afterrestarting ELO Dropzone, the folder is reactivated in ELO and the tile is restored.Deletions Monitored folders that still contain data will not be deleted along with their tile.â€¢ â€¢ 84 ELO DropzonePriorities Metadata information from tiles has priority in metadata fields. This means that tile informationmay overwrite presets and conditions of fields. An example of this would be a field that should onlyaccept a numeric entry. A tile would have no problem entering a word to the field.Tiles: global/personal Administrators create global tiles, which are seen by all users. Users create personal tiles. Thesetiles are only seen by those users specifically. Global tiles are always shown at the top of theDropzone, while personal tiles will appear further down.Language The language of ELO Dropzone will depend on your language settings in ELO. If the settings are notrecognized, the fallback language in ELO is English.Report You need to select the Enable report check box in the system settings so that ELO Dropzone cancreate a log file. This log file called ELOdropzone(x).txt in the user's temp directory. The directory islocated here: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp. If ELO Dropzone should not start, you canactivate the log via the Windows Registry Editor. To do so, you need to add the REG_SZ entry"report" with the value "true" under HKEYCURRENTUSER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\ELO DigitalOffice\dropzone. The log file is then located in the user's temp directory.Database access ELO Dropzone can access the database directly. No additional server components have to beinstalled. This access is performed via a registered function. The ELO Indexserver script realizingthis access must be located in the // Administration // IndexServer Scripting Base // _ALL folder.To connect to an external database, the database has to be configured on the ELO Indexserver(ELOix). This configuration in the ELOix</s> 
<s>has a name, which has to be specified in the Configuredisplay groups dialog box in the Database field. If you use the same database as ELO, you canleave the field blank and do not have to configure anything for ELOix.InformationPlease read the ELO Indexserver Programming Guide (ELOpress) for more information. The Access to external databases chapter describes in detail how to set up a databaseconnection pool on the application server.Java ELO Dropzone includes a self-contained version of the Java Runtime Environment, which is startedwhen you run ELO and receives the configuration and functions from ELO.85 ELO DropzoneCitrix environment When using Dropzone in a Citrix server environment, drag-and-drop from the local desktop/Windows Explorer is not possible. An exception to this is if a desktop is provided via Citrix. Onlythen can documents be dragged to ELO Dropzone. Filing via the ELO Dropzone folder monitoring isnot affected by this, as no desktop is required for it to work.86 ELO Dropzone Table of contents Introduction Structure Introduction Basics Usage examples Administration Basics Overview General note Installation and configuration Installation Start Starting ELO Dropzone with the ELO Java Client Start-up with ELOoffice Program interface Collapse/expand Display groups Buttons History New folder in ELO Context menu Global and personal tiles Edit system settings Configure display groups Tile types Setting up a filing tile Adding a new tile Defining filing tiles View Metadata form Activation Fields Target Save Result Setting up a search tile Type Adding a new tile Defining a search tile View Metadata form Fields Target Alternative: Activation via keyboard shortcut Setting up a script tile Adding a new tile Defining a script tile View Activation Target Example Setting up a template tile Preparations Type View Metadata form Activation Fields Target Use Create e-mail from template tile View Activation Fields Regular expressions Opening the wizard Available expressions New Delete Type, name, and source Reg.

<s>of the client. This is where you manage yourdocuments and data. ForÂ example, you can create new documents and folders, open documents inread-only mode, or send documents in different formats.The Repository is divided into the following areas:1 Repository structure: Overview of entries (folders or documents)2 Viewer pane: View of entries selected in the tree (folders or documents)21 ELO Java ClientYou can change the layout of the repository structure and create view profiles for the viewer pane.For more information, refer to the chapters Repository structure and Viewer pane.If there are a lot of documents in your repository, it can be helpful to create an additional view. Aview shows a section of the repository. It is also shown as a tile in the tile navigation.To create a new view, select a folder in the Repository work area. On the ribbon, click View > Newview.

Click OK.'Search' work area In the Search work area, you can search for files and documents in ELO. The search results aredisplayed here. You can create search favorites and search views.When you open the Search work area, an additional Search tab appears on the ribbon. The Searchtab contains different functions, such as for searching the metadata, creating search filters, andadding search favorites.InformationThe chapter Search entries explains how to run a search, narrow down the results, and viewthe hits.22 ELO Java ClientThe chapter 'Search' tab contains information on how to search the metadata using a formor create a dynamic folder.InformationYou can specify a keyboard shortcut that takes you straight to the search input field from awork area. Create a keyboard shortcut for the function Switch to search input field (availablein: Ribbon > User menu [your name] > Configuration > Quick access to functions). For moreinformation, refer to the chapter Configuration.Create search view If you use the New view function (plus icon at the end of the search results list) in the Search workarea, you create a temporary search view.A search view is used to temporarily save search results and search settings. Search views appearin a bar on top of the navigation bar.InformationMetadata searches are automatically saved as a temporary search view.Please noteThese search views are deleted when you close ELO. If you want to save a search request,use the Save search function (in the Search work area under Ribbon > Search > Searchfavorites).ELO iSearch functions ELO iSearch uses special search algorithms that improve the search function.iSearch offers the following functions:Autocomplete The autocomplete function provides a list of possible search terms that fit the character sequencealready entered. The longer the term you enter, the more exact the suggestions are. ELO iSearch23 ELO Java Clientonly suggests terms for matches in ELO. If no suggestions appear, there are no matches for thecharacter string entered. To search for a suggestion, double-click on the term.Autocorrect Autocorrect provides suggestions for search terms which return very few or no results. This can beespecially</s> 
<s>useful if you made a typing error while entering the search term. If this is the case, ELOwill suggest similar terms. A message appears underneath the search field: "Did you mean... "followed by the suggestions generated by ELO. Click on one of the suggested terms to show thesearch results for the chosen term.Linking search terms The Boolean search function, a form of complex search, enables you to formulate search queriesusing the AND and OR operators.AND connections search for matches that contain both terms.The operators for an AND search are:ANDInformationThe AND connection is enabled by default. If you enter more than one term, the terms areautomatically linked with AND unless you use another operator.OR connections search for matches that contain at least one of the terms.The operators for an OR search are:Example: Order, InvoiceLogical parentheses You can use logical parentheses to enter an alternative search string. Parentheses determine whichterms to search for in addition to the actual search term.ForÂ example, you may be searching for an invoice, but you are not sure if it was filed as an invoice,bill, or receipt. In this case, enter the term which should first be used to search and then add thetwo alternative terms in parentheses. I.e.: invoice (bill, receipt).â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 24 ELO Java ClientExclude terms The term that you want to exclude must be separated from the actual search term by a space and ahyphen (minus sign). For example, if you search for the term invoice and exclude the term receipt,you must enter the following search command: invoice -receipt.Phrase search The phrase search works with groups of words which are connected. This can be a fixed expression,e.Â g. write e-mails. It can also be any sequence of words. The phrase you are looking for must beplaced inside quotation marks. For example, if you want to find all documents with the wordcombination To Whom It May Concern, type the following: "To Whom It May Concern".Range search The range search enables you to limit the search to a specific range. This makes the search fasterand significantly increases the accuracy of the results.You need to enter the ranges in square brackets and separate them with TO. ForÂ example, you wantto search all folders in the range 03 to 05. Enter the search command [03 TO 05].Search for alternative terms ELO iSearch provides alternatives (synonyms) for many terms. Enter a space after the search term.ELO iSearch suggests corresponding synonyms if any are available. To add a synonym to a search,click the desired suggestion.Wildcard search It is also possible to use the placeholder (wildcard) *, as is common in other Windows programs, inthe search. This means you can use the * placeholder to search for sequences or character strings.InformationYou can use a question mark as a wildcard. However, you will then need to enter yoursearch term in lowercase letters. The question mark can only be used as a wildcard at theend of a word.Search for sequencesThere are several possibilities for this type of search, which will</s> 
<s>be explained with the followingexamples:Let us assume you are looking for companies with "ow" in the name. Enter *ow* in the Companyfield of the search form. The search will return all documents containing the letters "ow" in thecompany name, e.Â g. Owen, Townsend, etc. In other words, the search looks for the range betweenthe two asterisks.Search "Beginning with" or "Ending with"25 ELO Java ClientIf you omit either of the limits marked by the *, you will define a search as beginning with or ending with. This search option can be set as the default in the metadata forms. However, theoption is not visible in the metadata form.ForÂ example, you want to search for customers whose customer number starts with 15. To do so,enter 15* to the search form in the Customer number field. ELO finds all documents in which theentry in the Customer number field begins with 15. If you enter *er in the field Supplier, all thedocuments that have er at the end of the entry in the Supplier field will be found.InformationYou do not need to use the wildcard * in the Short name, Date, or Extra text fields. ELOdisplays all documents that contain the character string in the field in whatever form.Universal search ELO lets you perform a universal search for certain attributes. This applies to all fields that use thesame group as well as fields that have an identical component in the group name.If you want to search multiple metadata forms, the group names of the fields on differentkeywording forms have to be identical.

It also includes the permissions structure for the entry, meaning which usershave what access to the entry. The quality of a repository depends to a great extent on the qualityof the metadata. Metadata allows you to organize documents in a standardized way and file themquickly to ELO. In addition, using metadata makes it easier to find documents.A new metadata model was introduced with version ELO 21 in addition to the previous metadatamodel. Both models are used in parallel. In the following, these metadata models are referred to asgeneration 1 (gen. 1) and generation 2 (gen. 2).In gen. 2, forms and metadata forms are shown differently in the Metadata dialog box. Themetadata concept will remain the same.There are three ways to open the Metadata dialog box manually.

With the help of filters anddifferent views, you can edit data and analyze it in charts and tables.Workspaces are based on workspace types. These are created by administrators and define whichviews and filters are available to you. They also define which objects can be created in aworkspace.Objects Objects are a shell with metadata where entries can be compiled. Files and folders can be insertedin an object.Connections between objects are not established via a hierarchical structure, but by relations.The chapter Create object explains how to create an object.Relations You can establish a connection between objects, for example between a job application and theposition it was submitted for.You establish these connections using relation fields. Relation fields can be found in the metadataform of an object.In the table view, a relation is indicated by a button with a chain icon.If you've entered the corresponding position in the relation field of a job application, for example,the button with the chain icon takes you from the position to the application.

Metadataallows you to organize documents in a standardized way and file them quickly to ELO. In addition,metadata makes it easier to find documents.A new metadata model was introduced with version ELO 21 in addition to the previous metadatamodel. Both models are used in parallel. In the following, these metadata models are referred to asgeneration 1 (gen. 1) and generation 2 (gen. 2).In gen. 2, forms and metadata forms are shown differently in the Metadata dialog box.
