Connect to OneDrive

Check out to OneDrive 

The function Check out to OneDrive allows the user to check out Microsoft Office documents to

Microsoft OneDrive and edit them there. For the user, this is similar to the previous local check out

process. What's new is that the interface with Microsoft 365 allows for use of Microsoft Office

Online and collaborative working.

You can find more information about using the function in the client in the user documentation:

ELO Java Client

ELO Web Client

ELO Desktop Client

Requirements 

General technical requirements 

ELO Server Setup version 21.3 and higher

Connection to Microsoft 365 with modern authentication (OAuth 2.0)

App registration in Microsoft Azure of an app for ELO for Microsoft 365

Activated ELOauth plug-in for ELO Indexserver (ELOix)

Activated O365sync plug-in for ELO Indexserver

Please note

The Check out to OneDrive function can only be used with the OAuth authentication method,

as Microsoft OneDrive requires an OAuth2 token. The SAML method cannot be used for the 

Check out to OneDrive function.

For more information on the ELOauth plug-in and the OAuth 2.0 authentication method, refer to the 

ELOauth Plug-in documentation.

Requirements for user authentication 

All users require a Microsoft work or school account with Microsoft OneDrive for Business.

All users must be configured with their Microsoft work or school account in the ELO

Administration Console and logged on to the corresponding ELO client.

Register new app in Microsoft Azure 

To connect to Microsoft 365 with modern authentication (OAuth 2.0), you need a new app in your

Microsoft Azure environment. You will learn how to do this and what to consider during

configuration in the following.

The newly created client secret is now configured for your app.

Please note

Write down the value of the secret immediately after you create it. This value is no longer

shown in its entirety when you open the overview of secrets at a later point in time.

You will need this value to configure the ELOauth plug-in (see the section Configure ELOauth

plug-in).

Configure plug-ins 

Logging on ELO with a Microsoft account requires two plug-ins for ELOix:

auth-plugin-<version number>.jar

o365sync-plugin-<version number>.jar

The ELO Server Setup installs these plug-ins to the directory \<ELO>\prog\webapps\ix-plugins.

To update these plug-ins, proceed as follows:

Download the plug-ins from the ELO SupportWeb.

Open the \<ELO>\prog\serversetup2\repository folder.

Store the files auth-plugin-<version number>.jar and o365sync-plugin-<version number>.jar

in this folder.

Switch to the \<ELO>\prog\serversetup2 folder.

Run the setup.bat file.

Configure ELOauth plug-in 

The connection between ELO and the Microsoft Azure app is established via the 

de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json file. You will learn how to configure this file in the following.

Open the \<ELO>\config\ix-<repository>\ELO-SRV01-1 folder.

Create the file de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json.

Alternative: If the file already exists, open it.

Add the details of your newly registered app to the file.

The following example shows a possible configuration of the JSON file:

For more information on configuring the plug-in, refer to the ELOauth plug-in – existing

implementations documentation.

Save the file and restart the ELO Indexserver.

Connect to ELO clients 

To enable logon via Microsoft 365, you will have to set up authentication via the ELOauth plug-in in

the ELO clients.

ELO Java Client and ELO Desktop Client 

Create a new profile in the ELO client.

In this profile, configure a URL following this pattern:

3. 

{

  "<App name or config ID>": {

    "mapping": "mail",

    "api": "azure",

    "appKey": "<App ID>",

    "appSecret": "<Value of the client secret>",

    "azureTenant": "<Directory ID>",

    "fixedCallbackUrl": "https://<ELO>:<port>/"

  }
