ELO PDF Printer GS

Basic requirements 

Installing the ELO printers requires Windows 7 or higher. With the ELO PDF Printer GS, the ELO PS

Converter is also installed automatically if your computer is connected to the Internet. Otherwise,

you will have to download the converter from the following address before installing the ELO PDF

Printer GS: http://gs.elo.com/PSconv/ELOPSConverter12.msi.

Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in the printer installation directory for the latest version:

The printer calls up the ELO PS Converter after the print process. This tool generates the PDF file

from the PostScript file created by the printer.

Checks after installation

A log file is created if the registry entry HKCU\Software\ELO Digital\PdfPrinter\Debug (string) is set

to 1.

The registry entry under HKLM creates the log file for all users. Keep in mind that the 32-bit branch

of the registry is used for HKLM on 64-bit systems (HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\ELO

Digital\PdfPrinter\Debug).

The log file is located at %APPDATA%\Elo\ELOPdfPrint.log.

The converter log file is <Program Data Dir>\ELO Digital Office\EloPsConverter.log. The directory

must already exist.

For more information, refer to the ReadMe.txt file.

To print a document, the corresponding application has to be installed.

You can check this as follows:

ELO printer no longer works after update 

During updates, old printer drivers are not removed correctly, so you will have to uninstall the ELO

printer and remove all driver files.

The driver file is located in the directory

printer changes, you won't notice.

Close all other programs in Windows Task Manager and conversion should work.
