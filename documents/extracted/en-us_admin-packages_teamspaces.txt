enter the following in the app's manifest (manifest.json):

This entry is a list of widget types that this ELO app is available for.

Define roles 

In a teamspace, users have different roles with different associated rights and permissions. You can

define roles in this area.

A teamspace contains four pre-defined roles with defined rights and permissions:

Administrator: The creator of a teamspace is automatically assigned the role of 

Administrator. Other team members can also be assigned the role of Administrator.

Administrators have all the rights to the teamspace and all permissions to the contents in the

teamspace.

Moderator: Users with this role have the right to edit the teamspace but not delete it. Like

administrators, they have all the permissions to the contents of the teamspace.

Member: Users with this role have the permissions to view, edit, and delete contents in the

teamspace.

Guest: Users with this role have permission to view the contents in the teamspace.

Information

The Administrator role cannot be edited or deleted.

Overview of functions 

New role: Add a role to the teamspace template. See the following section for additional

information on this.

Roles: Selecting one of the existing roles lets you see the role's settings and edit them if you

have the rights and permissions (main administrator).

Default for new team members: Select which role is set as standard for new members.

You can grant the following special teamspace rights:

changes to a teamspace. They can also change the roles assigned to members in the

teamspace and add new members.

a teamspace.

You can grant the following default permissions for contents in a teamspace:

View (R): Users have read access to the entry. They cannot modify the entry.

Change metadata (W): Users can edit the metadata of the entry.

Delete (D): Users can delete the entry.

Edit (E) (documents only): Users can edit the selected entry. This means that they can

change the working version and upload a new version.

Edit list (L) (folders only): Users can change the contents of the folder. For example,

you can create documents in this folder or move or remove documents from the folder.

Set permissions (P): Users can change the permissions for the selected folder.

The current teamspace rights and permissions only take effect if the user has the

corresponding user rights.

Click Save template.

The teamspace template is saved. The role can now be used for new teamspaces. Existing

teamspaces with this teamspace template do not take on the role.
