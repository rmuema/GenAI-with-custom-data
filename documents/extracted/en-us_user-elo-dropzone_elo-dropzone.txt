3 ELO Dropzone



Basics 

Overview 

ELO Dropzone makes it easier for you to file incoming documents to ELO. Simply drag documents

and files to a defined tile. ELO Dropzone enters the corresponding metadata and files your

documents based on your own rules. This provides you with easy access to frequently used

functions and enables you to file documents more easily to ELO. A database connection allows for

interfaces to programs, such as ERP systems. You can then use this data for metadata, for

example.

You can set up filing tiles, search tiles, script tiles, and template tiles. With a search tile, you can

configure the desired search terms via the metadata fields of a metadata form. It is also possible to

define search tiles that you can activate using keyboard shortcuts. With a script tile, you can call a

script event-controlled. With a template tile, you can create documents from templates in ELO

Dropzone.

You can also create additional variables with regular expressions in ELO Dropzone that can be used

to define tiles.

General note 

The program works with the following clients:

ELO Java Client

ELOoffice

The function descriptions and screenshots in this manual were created using the ELO Java Client.

The following ELO Dropzone functions are not available with ELOoffice:

foreground. The change will take effect once you restart ELO Dropzone.

Information

Refer to the Administration chapter to learn how to make changes to the configuration via

the extra text of the metadata form.

Configure display groups 

You can form groups for each work area. This helps you structure ELO Dropzone, as the tiles are

spread across different display groups. Areas are defined by the administrator. Individual users can

dynamically determine which groups they'd like to see. It is also possible to move individual tiles

between work areas. You can also access the database directly via the individual display groups.

Information from the selected database can then be used for the metadata. If you have created

custom groups and already defined tiles, you have to explicitly add the existing tiles to your

groups. The first display group should always be called Start. All tiles that are not assigned to a

10 ELO Dropzone



display group are automatically added to the Start group. As no database query is necessary in the 

Start display group, you can leave the other fields blank.

Open the Configure display groups dialog box from the ELO Dropzone context menu. Click Edit

groups.

The Configure display groups dialog box opens.

On the left, you can see the display groups created up to now.

Plus icon: Add a new display group.

Delete icon: Delete a display group selected on the left.

Name: Enter a name for the display group.

Icon: To change the icon for the display group, click the gray tile icon.

Color: Click the color square to change the color of the display group.

Database: To connect to an external database, the database has to be configured on the ELO

Indexserver (ELOix). This configuration in ELOix has a name, which has to be specified here. If you

use the same database as ELO, you can leave the field blank and do not have to configure anything

for ELOix.

11 ELO Dropzone



Information

Please read the ELO Indexserver Programming Guide for more information. The Access to

external databases chapter describes in detail how to set up a database connection pool on

the application server.

SQL query: Formulate an SQL query in this field. In the example above (see figure), the Microsoft

sample database (Northwind) is accessed. You should know what tables and column names exist in

the selected SQL database. Select the columns you want to use as variables in the return. You can

prepare and test the SQL query in a tool of your choice, for example SQL Server Management

Studio. Once the query returns the desired results in the tool, you can replace the query text with a

placeholder for user input. The placeholder is:

Filter field beside SQL query: If the database query works properly, you can test the SQL statement

via this filter field. The first selected data set is entered to the Return table. This allows you to

configure the return step by step. You can define an identifier for the return for each selected data

set.

Return: Define the variable in the the Identifier column per number. In the Identifier column, double-

click the field you'd like to change. Complete your entry by pressing the ENTER key. If you click

elsewhere, your input will be discarded. With the arrow keys, you can navigate between fields and

activate the desired field by pressing the ENTER key in order to edit it. You can transform any

columns of the database into variables. Ideally, you can configure the variables using the filter field

(see above). Choose variable names that clearly indicate where the variables come from. The

result is a better structured group, helping you to prevent errors in assigning variables to metadata

fields in the tile definition.

Display: Configure what is displayed and how. You can drag the defined variables from the Return

field to the desired position in the Display field. You can also enter fixed texts. The test output is

shown in the field on the right.

Save: Once you have finished configuring the display group, click Save.

Cancel: The configuration for the selected display group is not saved.

Tile types 

You can create four different tile types in ELO Dropzone:

Filing tile

Search tile

Script tile

Template tile

The configuration for these tile types is described in the following.

The Form tab opens.

Click one of the available metadata forms.

You have linked the tile to a metadata form.

Information

If you use a folder-only form, a folder is created when entering the metadata and the

document is saved to this folder with the Free entry metadata form.

Please note

Metadata forms assigned the document status Non-modifiable cannot be used in ELO

Dropzone. This is because ELO Dropzone files the logical document and then adds the file.

Activation 

The Activation tab offers additional options for defining tiles. The choice of options depends on the

selected tile type.

2. 

17 ELO Dropzone



You can enable directory monitoring for filing tiles.

If you select the option Documents\ELO folder monitoring for Office documents, the filing tile

becomes a monitoring tile.

ELO Dropzone monitors the following path in the Windows file system:

C:\Users\<Windows user>\Documents\ELO\<tile name>

If a Microsoft Office document is saved to one of these child folders, it is filed to ELO automatically

according to the settings for that tile.

If you click Cancel to stop entering metadata for a document from the folder monitoring, the

document is saved to the Not filed folder in the file system: C:\Users\<Windows

user>\Documents\ELO\Not filed.

18 ELO Dropzone



Under Monitor PDF printer directory, you can automatically file documents to an output directory of

a virtual PDF printer.

Define the output directory via the system settings: Context menu > System settings > PDF printer

directory.

Drag a variable to the Recognition field.

The corresponding documents are recognized in the output directory based on this variable. If

the Recognition field remains empty, the PDF printer directory is not monitored.

Information

To create additional variables with regular expressions, refer to the chapter on Regular

expressions.

Optional: Right-click the To printer field to open the list of available printers. You can use this printer

to print your document.

Select a printer.

Optional: When the Send as e-mail option is enabled, the detected documents from the printer

directory are attached to an e-mail and sent.

You need a script to enable this option. Building a script requires administrator rights.

For the ELO Java Client, file the JS.SendMail script to // Administration // Java Client Scripting Base.

The sample script should look like this.

1. 

1. 

function fromVBS_SendMail(param) {

  var data = fromString(param)

  var fileName = data["File.Path"]

  var name = data["File.NameNoExt"]

  if (fileName) {

    workspace.sendMail(name, "", "", [fileName])

19 ELO Dropzone



For ELOoffice, you need to create a script with the name JS.SendMail.VBS via the ELO menu > 

System settings > Scripts.

The script looks like this:

    return

  }

}

function fromString(param) {

  var result = new Object()

  var lines = param.split("\n")

  for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {

    var line = lines[i]

    var ipos = line.indexOf("\t")

    if (ipos > 0) {

      var key = line.substring(0, ipos)

      var value = line.substring(ipos + 1)

      result[key] = value

    }

  }

  return result

}

Set ELO = CreateObject("ELO.office")

Set oOutlook=CreateObject("Outlook.Application")

msg = ELO.GetCookie("JS.PARAM")

Data = Split(msg, vbLf)

for i = 0 to UBound(Data)

Line = Data(i)

if Left(Line, 9) = "File.Path" Then

Parts = Split( Line, vbTab )

20 ELO Dropzone



You need to create the JS.SendMail script via the ELO menu > System settings > Scripts in the ELO

Windows Client. This requires administrator rights.

Use the above VB script JS.SendMail to do this (see ELOoffice). You need to change the script in one

place: Enter the object name ELO.professional instead of ELO.professional in the first line of the

script.

Fields 

Click the Fields tab.

Set oMail=oOutlook.CreateItem(0)

oMail.Subject = "From Dropzone"

call oMail.Attachments.Add(Parts(1), 0, 1)

oMail.Display

end if

Next

1. 

21 ELO Dropzone



The Fields tab opens.

On the left, you see all fields of the selected metadata form. You see the existing variables in

the Available variables area.

Load a sample document via the Load button to import additional variables. For example, if

you load a Word document, Word opens briefly to analyze the document. ELO Dropzone then

adds the detected metadata to the list of available variables.

In addition to the method described above, there is a more effective method of reading

metadata. When you are in edit mode, you can drag and drop the file to the desired tile. The

tile configuration menu opens automatically. You now find metadata variables for the file in

the corresponding tabs. The number of variables you can choose from depends on the file

type.

You can add metadata using the form fields in Microsoft Word, for example. In the form field

properties, you can enter a value to the Text box field. Afterwards, you can select this

variable from the list in the tile configuration with the syntax Word.\<form field name>.

It is also possible to read header data in Microsoft Word documents. Once you have dragged

the document containing headers to a tile, the variable Header.x shows up in the list of

available variables.

2. 

22 ELO Dropzone



Now assign or drag and drop the available variables or fixed text to the fields of the selected

metadata form.

The variables are displayed in the fields in curly brackets. This information means that every

time a document is processed using this tile, ELO immediately recognizes which data to

read.

Information

You can also drag multiple variables to one field with this method.

You can also read just parts of metadata, such as the first three letters of a first or last name. To do

this, enter the position of the first letter to be read and the number of letters to be read after the

data inside the curly bracket. For example, entering {All.Author(1,3)} only reads the first three

letters starting from the first character.

Target 

Click the Target tab once you have defined the assignment of the fields.

The Target tab opens.

Enter the filing path in the ELO repository to the Filing path field.

1. 

2. 

23 ELO Dropzone



The following applies for path definitions in ELO Dropzone:

Use the Delimiter button to create a pilcrow symbol for separating the folder levels.

The definition must start with a separator.

Do not end a path with a separator as the path will otherwise be displayed incorrectly.

You can enter both full and relative target paths.

The name for the individual fields in a metadata form begins with Grp.. Accordingly, the short

name would be Grp.0, the date would be Grp.1, the third field would be Grp.2 and so on.

Other available variables include Clipboard.ALL for reading the Clipboard or Date.ThisMonth

for the month of filing.

If you want to define a second filing target as a reference, separate the first and second

definition with a pipe symbol ("|").

If the pipe symbol occurs in the path definition, you can separate the reference paths with

the Unicode character "‼". When this character appears in the path definition, it is used as the

separator and the pipe symbol is ignored.

If you have not created any reference paths and you still want to permit the pipe symbol in

the text, insert the "!!" character at the end. This generates an empty reference path that is

ignored.

Here is an example of a target path with a multiple filing definition:

¶Orders¶{Date.This.Year}¶{Date.ThisMonth}|Orders¶{Grp.2(1,1)}¶{Grp.2}

Alternative: Clicking Apply path uses the path selected in ELO as the filing target.

You see all the Available variables on the right-hand side. You can drag these variables to the path

in ELO.

Click Load to load a sample document to the configuration. ELO automatically reads all the

metadata in the document. You can now drag individual metadata to the fields.

If the filing path does not exist, it will be created automatically.

In the File to/search in ELO area, the File directly or search without dialog box option is selected.

The file is filed directly without confirmation.

Optional: Check the Delete original file after filing box to delete the original file after filing.

Optional: Database search: Run a database query. The value entered here overrules manual entries

in the Direct entry field.

Save 

Click Save once you have made all changes.

The Configure tile dialog box closes. The new filing tile appears in ELO Dropzone. ELO

Dropzone remains in edit mode.

Right-click the context menu and the Finish editing entry in ELO Dropzone to finish editing.

function fromVBS_Test(param) {

workspace.showInfoBox("ELO", param);

}

Please note

46 ELO Dropzone



Because there is no scroll function in ELO Dropzone, there is a limit to the number of tiles

you can create. The number of tiles you can create depends on your screen resolution

settings.

Setting up a template tile 

With a template tile, you can create documents from Microsoft Word templates in ELO Dropzone.

Clicking the template tile creates new documents, which will be assigned the corresponding

Overview 

The table below contains a list of basic regular expressions and their meanings.

62 ELO Dropzone



Information

If you want to use a regular expression to create all types of line breaks, \n is not specific

enough. In this case, use the regular expression (?:\r\n|\n|\r).

Tile collection 

You can share tiles you created yourself with other users in the ELO Java Client. Other users can

then access shared tiles via the Tile collection and import them into their own ELO Dropzone.

63 ELO Dropzone



Preparations 

To use the Share tile function in ELO Dropzone, the administrator must make the following

preparations in the ELO Java Client.

Set up a new child folder with the name Store in the folder // Administration // Dropzone.

Create additional child folders in the Store folder. The child folders can be named as required.

For example, you can create a folder for each department or depending on the filing type.

The user needs the permission Edit lists (L) for this child folder to share tiles. The user needs Read

(R) permission to import tiles from a part of the tile collection. The administrator can set these

permissions for every child folder via the metadata.

Share tile 

Share a tile you configured yourself with other users.

Open the context menu in ELO Dropzone by right-clicking and then clicking Edit mode for

personal tiles.

Information

To ensure that the shared tile and its function are easy to identify in the tile collection, we

recommend that you enter a meaningful description of its function in the Description field of

the tile configuration.

66 ELO Dropzone



The tile selected from the Tile collection is copied into your own ELO Dropzone.

Activate a tile from another application 

Tiles can be activated via the OLE interface of the ELO Java Client or via an elodms link.

You can download and import a file from an e-mail message or a website in ELO. You only need to

enter an appropriately formatted elodms URL to do this. In this case, the elodms link always starts

with the following parameters:

elodms://dz/\<tile name\>|

The URL can either contain a file name or an HTTP address. If you use a file name, it must be

visible locally on the client computer. The file name is then added to the elodms link with URL

encoding.

Example: elodms://dz/Rechnung|c:\rechnung.tif

If you use an HTTP download address, you have to add the identifier http, followed by a pipe

symbol and the extension (such as PDF). This is followed by another pipe symbol and then the

download address. This part must be URL-encoded for a valid link to result.

Example: elodms://dz/Report|http|pdf|www.forum.elo.com%2Fscript%2FAddNoteConfirmFlow.pdf

You can, for example, send this elodms URL as an e-mail attachment. When the recipient of this e-

mail clicks the link, the file is downloaded and transferred to the tile specified – as if you had

dragged it to the tile.

67 ELO Dropzone

Search for customer name via customer number 

Information 

In this example, we will link the following functions: hotkey (activation via keyboard shortcut),

reading the window title, database query, and search. A program shows the current customer

number in the window title. You want to use this number to perform a search via keyboard shortcut

in ELO. You will use the customer number to search for the customer name. This requires an

upstream database query. Our example uses the ELO user list as a "customer database".

Step by step 

To capture the customer number from the window title, you need a regular expression. Our

example assumes that the window title contains the text USER-, followed by the user ID, e.g. 

USER-3.

Open the Regular expressions dialog box via the context menu.

Click New to create a new regular expression.

In the Name field, select Title from the drop-down menu to show the window title.

Enter the name UserId.

In the Reg.Ex. field, enter the following regular expression: USER-(\d*).

The result appears.

Save the regular expression.

The regular expression is listed under Available expressions as Title.UserId.

Querying the customer data for the customer number requires a group. The SQL query for

converting the user ID into the user name is configured in the group, and the variable name

"ID.name" is defined for the user name.

In the context menu, click Edit groups to open the Configure display groups dialog box.

Click the plus icon to create a new display group named UserId and enter the SQL query as

shown in the figure below.

Generating an e-mail from a customer number 

Information 

We want to determine the customer number from the window title using a regular expression. We

want to generate an e-mail with the recipient address filled out via a search tile with configured

keyboard shortcut and database query.

Step by step 

This template tile is created in the same group as in the previous example and thus uses the

existing database query and regular expression for identifying the customer number in the window

title.

Follow steps 1-9 from the Search for customer name via customer number example.

In the UserId display group, create a new template tile via the context menu in editing mode.

1.

Administration 

Dropzone Administration folder 

The module automatically creates a folder named Dropzone within the Administration folder in

ELO. The information is stored there as text files, which you can export individually or as entire

folders to other repositories. The Dropzone folder contains the following child entries:

Global: All global tiles are saved in this folder. These tiles are available for all users. In

general, an administrator can create multiple global folders and make them visible to

different user groups via ELO permissions. Since all folders have to have the name Global, it

is recommended to assign the folders color markers for a better overview. We recommend

controlling the creation of multiple global folders with user IDs (see below).

Store (ELO Java Client): The tile definitions for the tile collection are saved to this folder. The

tile collection is split into multiple areas. The administrator can determine these areas by

adding the desired area folders below the Store folder. The administrator can determine via

the permissions of the area folders which users can add tiles to this area of the collection

and which areas are visible to the user.

User.<User-ID>: The personal tile definitions of each user are saved in this folder. In

addition, the ELO Dropzone configuration is saved in the extra text of the user folder. If you

want to specify a different name for the global folder, for example to assign specific user

groups a selection of multiple global folders, enter Global=\<other folder name> to the extra

text.

Information

The settings in these folders are stored as text files which you can export individually or as

entire folders to other repositories.

Administration folder. If not, add the folder manually.

For ELO Dropzone to find the basic folder, the Dropzone users must have at least View (R) object

permission to the folder. As ELO Dropzone automatically creates user folders that do not exist yet,

the users should also have Edit lists (L) permissions.

A user requires at least read access to their ELO Dropzone folder. When this permission is revoked,

ELO Dropzone assumes that no user folder was created yet and creates it again. It also makes

sense for the user to have Edit lists (L) permissions so that new tiles can be saved there. If you

remove this permission, the Indexserver prevents users from saving new tiles. However, as ELO

82 ELO Dropzone



Dropzone doesn't expect the permission to be revoked for the user, this may result in an error

message.

Permission for the tile collection 

Users only need read access to the store folder. Only administrators that can add new categories

need Edit lists (L) permissions. In general, you should, however, give these users full access to the

folder so that existing entries can be edited or deleted.

The administrator can determine via the permissions to the category which categories a user can

see and therefore import tiles from this category. Furthermore, the administrator can define via Edit

lists (L) permissions which users can export their own tiles into the tile collection.

In the example, all users have read permission to all categories. However, they only have Expand

content permissions for the first two categories. If users want to share a tile, they are only offered

these two categories as the destination.

The Load tile from collection function offers all four categories as the user has the read permission

for all of them.

Configuring ELO Dropzone 

Make general settings for all ELO Dropzone tiles via System settings in the context menu (see 

Installation and configuration chapter). Alternatively, you can enter configuration settings for ELO

Dropzone in the Administration folder of the repository. You can also configure additional settings

here that are not available in the System settings dialog box.

83 ELO Dropzone



Open the ELO Dropzone folder under the Administration folder in your Client.

// Administration // Dropzone // Global for global settings

// Administration // Dropzone // User.<User-ID> for personal settings

Open the metadata form for the folder and switch to the Extra text tab, then enter various

parameters there.

Start ELO Dropzone minimized: In the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: 

start=minimized. By default, ELO Dropzone starts expanded; the parameter for this is: start=normal.

Select an animation mode: In the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: 

animation=<setting>. 0, 6, and 8 are possible values for this setting. If 0, ELO Dropzone determines

an appropriate animation mode when maximizing or minimizing its display. If 6, the size is

continually recalculated during the animation. If 8, there is no animation and the window

immediately switches from expanded to collapsed, or vice versa.

PDF printer output directory: In the metadata form, switch to the Extra text tab and enter: 

Printer.Dir=<PDF printer directory>. This parameter specifies the PDF printer output directory. It

does not need to use the ELO PDF printer. Any source for PDF files is allowed.

PDF and TIFF file OCR evaluation: Open the Extra text tab in the metadata form and enter: 

maxfulltextpages=<setting>. Use this parameter to determine the maximum number of pages per

document to be processed during OCR preprocessing. Recommended setting: ten pages.

Regular expressions: The administrator can store multiple regular expressions for metadata

detection. The regular expressions can be used for the recognition of window titles or file paths and

can analyze them. The definitions of regular expressions are saved to the Extra text of the Global

folder. Each line in the Extra text contains a definition. The definition is made up of different

components: first the name of the variable to be used later on, then an equal sign followed by the

regular expression itself.

Information

To comment out a line, enter a # in front of it.

Restoring deleted tiles 

You can restore deleted tiles in two steps. In the ELO client, click Organize > Delete > Show deleted

entries. The tile configuration folder reappears in the Administration folder, but it will be shown in

square brackets, meaning it is not currently active. Click Restore in the same group. Result: After

restarting ELO Dropzone, the folder is reactivated in ELO and the tile is restored.

Deletions 

Monitored folders that still contain data will not be deleted along with their tile.

Priorities 

Metadata information from tiles has priority in metadata fields. This means that tile information

may overwrite presets and conditions of fields. An example of this would be a field that should only

accept a numeric entry. A tile would have no problem entering a word to the field.

Tiles: global/personal 

Administrators create global tiles, which are seen by all users. Users create personal tiles. These

tiles are only seen by those users specifically. Global tiles are always shown at the top of the

Dropzone, while personal tiles will appear further down.

Language 

The language of ELO Dropzone will depend on your language settings in ELO. If the settings are not

recognized, the fallback language in ELO is English.

Report 

You need to select the Enable report check box in the system settings so that ELO Dropzone can

create a log file. This log file called ELOdropzone(x).txt in the user's temp directory. The directory is

located here: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp. If ELO Dropzone should not start, you can

activate the log via the Windows Registry Editor. To do so, you need to add the REG_SZ entry

"report" with the value "true" under HKEYCURRENTUSER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\ELO Digital

Office\dropzone. The log file is then located in the user's temp directory.

Database access 

ELO Dropzone can access the database directly. No additional server components have to be

installed. This access is performed via a registered function. The ELO Indexserver script realizing

this access must be located in the // Administration // IndexServer Scripting Base // _ALL folder.

To connect to an external database, the database has to be configured on the ELO Indexserver

(ELOix). This configuration in the ELOix has a name, which has to be specified in the Configure

display groups dialog box in the Database field. If you use the same database as ELO, you can

leave the field blank and do not have to configure anything for ELOix.

Information

Please read the ELO Indexserver Programming Guide (ELOpress) for more information. The 

Access to external databases chapter describes in detail how to set up a database

connection pool on the application server.

Java 

ELO Dropzone includes a self-contained version of the Java Runtime Environment, which is started

when you run ELO and receives the configuration and functions from ELO.

Citrix environment 

When using Dropzone in a Citrix server environment, drag-and-drop from the local desktop/

Windows Explorer is not possible. An exception to this is if a desktop is provided via Citrix. Only

then can documents be dragged to ELO Dropzone. Filing via the ELO Dropzone folder monitoring is

not affected by this, as no desktop is required for it to work.
