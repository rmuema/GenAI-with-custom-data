ELO Health Check Service

Requirements 

The ELO Health Check Service enables you to log and visualize different server parameters. In

addition, you can monitor specific threshold values, and set up an automatic e-mail notification if

the values exceed the limits.

If you want to use the ELO Health Check Service (in the following: HCS), you must make sure that

you enter the corresponding URL in the Indexserver Configuration Options configuration interface

and that the ELO Indexserver is allowed to send data to this URL. The data for the previous day is

sent in the early morning hours of the following day on a daily basis.

In the Indexserver Configuration Options configuration interface, use an uploadHealthCheckurl type

entry with the following URL:

If no URL is entered or the URL to the first version of the ELO Health Check Service is entered, the

URL specified above is entered in the database/the old value is replaced with this correct URL.

Enter NONE to disable transmission of the URL data.

You have to send a request to the ELO Order Center to enable ELO HCS. You can submit this request

to the ELO Order Center by e-mail.

A technical contact person for the partner and the customer were specified when you placed the

order. These e-mail addresses are used by all automated processes. Ideally, you should use a

separate technical e-mail account for this.

Health Check data is only sent from Indexserver versions ELO 20 or higher. Older ELO Indexservers

are unable to provide this service.

Starting with ELO 12, the installer distinguishes between production and test instances. When using

the HCS, it is necessary to separate them in any case to ensure that test data is not mixed up with

production data, which can lead to unreliable data visualizations.

Since the ELO HCS Dashboard shows data from the past, we recommend that you first install it and

configure the dashboard itself a few days later. This will enable you to see data about the current

installation during the configuration.

3 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Initial logon 

To authenticate, open the following URL:

When you log on for the first time, you won't have a password as this would need to have been

sent by e-mail, which is not secure.

Click Password forgotten.

In the next dialog box, you need to enter your e-mail address and the GUID from the serial

number. You can read this GUID from the license file, for example:

1. 

https://license.elo.com/HealthCheckService2/index.html

1. 

2. 

4 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Information

The GUID is only the combination of characters inside the brackets. The brackets

themselves and the preceding text are not part of the GUID.

You will only receive a link for a new password if this combination is correct. The e-mail

address must be identical to the address you entered when placing the order. You cannot

have a new password sent to any other e-mail address.

If the data was correct, you will receive an e-mail with a link within a short time. This link

takes you to the new password and can only be used once.

Open the link.

When you click the link, the HCS generates a new password and displays it over an

encrypted HTTPS connection. The password is therefore not transmitted via an insecure

channel, such as e-mail.

3. 

5 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Make a note of this password. We recommend saving it in your browser so that you do not

have to enter it each time. It is not possible to assign your own password.

You now have all the information you need to log on to the system.

4. 

6 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



In the Name field, you can enter the name from the serial number, the GUID, or the e-mail address.

When you log on for the first time, you will see a default dashboard containing the most important

parameters. If you installed a fresh ELO Indexserver or only recently entered the configuration, all

charts will be empty because no data has been sent yet.

Please note

In case of extensions or changes to the serial number, the following applies:

If the GUID of the serial number remains the same (extension of serial number), the

data is maintained by ELO HCS.

If a new serial number is used and the old one is deleted, the previous ELO HCS data

is lost. You have to register the new GUID to restart data analysis by ELO HCS.

7 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Configure dashboard 

To add charts, click the + Add graph function.

After clicking this field, you will be offered a list of monitoring parameters to choose from.

You can add multiple charts at this point and edit them later. A new entry is always inserted

after the last entry you edited. You can also arrange the charts differently later on using drag-

and-drop.

If you click the Settings button, you can change the settings of the chart.

1. 

2. 

8 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Name: You can change the name of the chart here. This can be useful if you have multiple

ELO Indexservers or want to view the same chart type with different settings, for example.

Hourly/Daily/Weekly: You can use this setting to change the visualization of data changes

over time. If you want to observe a trend over longer periods of time, it is useful to visualize

the data averaged over weeks. If you want a more detailed overview of the current situation,

it makes sense to create an hourly view, e.g. when most users log on during the course of a

day. In many other cases, the daily overview is the most practical option.

Day selection: If you want to restrict the daily or hourly overview to certain days of the week,

you can do so with this option.

Indexserver: If you have installed multiple ELO Indexservers, you can specify which ELO

Indexserver should be displayed here. If you enter 0 in the field, the total values of all ELO

Indexservers are displayed. If the field contains an Indexserver ID, only the values of this ELO

Indexserver are displayed. You can get the ID from the ELO Indexserver status page. You need

to take the value from the line IXID numeric.

Information

9 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



In later versions, you will be able to select from a list of available ELO Indexservers.

This list can only contain servers that have already transmitted data so it will be

empty on the day of installation.

Duration: Specify a period of time for the data visualization here. We recommend that you

specify a range from a few days or weeks in the past to the current date. The time ranges are

entered in days. The default setting covers the last three months. To be exact, "93 days ago

until now", i.e. 93...0.

Scale: With the Minimum – Average – Maximum charts, there may be maximum values which

are so high that the average values are only displayed as a flat line at the bottom of the

chart.

This parameter allows you to specify a divider factor for each line. If the average search time

is 50 milliseconds, but there are searches that take up to one minute, you can set MAX

divider to 1000.

10 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



These settings allow you to monitor large outliers in a chart simultaneously, as well as the

general (much smaller) average value.

11 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



If you want to see both the long-term trend and the current situation for a specific parameter

in a more granular view, you can create multiple charts for this parameter. The first chart

could be a weekly overview of 180 days, and a second chart could be a daily overview of the

last three days.

12 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Set up monitors 

To set up monitors, click the configuration icon in the upper right corner to switch to the ELO Health

Check Service Configuration. In this menu, you can set up monitors for each recorded parameter.

The HCS distinguishes between two types of parameters. There are counters, such as for the

number of logons or number of garbage collections, and Min/Max/Avr, which display average values

as well as minimum and maximum values, such as the required memory or the number of active

users.

Under Counter Properties, you can monitor absolute threshold values, such as for failed logon

attempts. If there are more than ten failed attempts in an hour, this indicates a brute force attack

on passwords.

You can also specify threshold values as a percentage. These relate to the average over the last

three months, e.g. if the number of garbage collections increases by more than 50%, this indicates

that the ELO Indexserver does not have enough heap space.

As the values can fluctuate considerably on different days of the week, the specified percentage

limits are only compared with the average on the same day of the week to prevent false alerts.

13 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



The Min/Max/Avr properties have the same settings, although three are shown here for each chart.

It makes sense to monitor the average values to detect gradual changes. Checking the maximum

values is better suited to detect acute problems.

14 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Information for partners 

If you specified a partner's e-mail address when you placed the order, this serial number is linked

to the partner's account. As a partner, you can access the page https://license.elo.com/

HealthCheckService2/alerts.html to obtain an overview of the current state of all customers.

If there are no alerts for a customer, the icon to the left of the customer name is green. If no HCS

data has been sent in the last three days, the icon is red. If limits have been exceeded, the icon is

yellow and the corresponding values are displayed.

Clicking the colored icon takes you to the respective customer dashboard. There is currently no

distinction between a partner request and a customer request. This has the advantage that a

partner can configure the customer dashboard and modify it at any time. However, this also means

that there are no different views for customers and partners.

If thresholds were set for a chart, the warning e-mail is sent to both the customer's e-mail address

and the partner's e-mail address.

If customers do not want to manage their own HCS dashboard, this can also be done by the partner.

In this case, you should create a separate e-mail account, e.g. ELO-HCS@mycompany.com. This is the

15 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



account that you need to specify as the customer's account when you place the order. However,

you do not need to create a separate account for each customer. You can still log on to the

dashboard with this account, since the API token can be used to distinguish between the different

customers.

16 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Data protection 

The ELO Health Check Service only records average values from an entire server every hour. No

personal data is collected or transmitted in the process, and it is not possible to draw conclusions

about individual users from the data.

However, you should still keep the password and API token safe, since the HCS contains data that

could be sensitive in certain contexts (e.g. the number of logons allows conclusions to be drawn

about the number of employees). An attacker requires both the serial number GUID and the API

token to gain unauthorized access. As this is generated automatically, a new one can be issued

immediately if there is any cause for concern.
