ELO Integration Client

General 

Basic range of functions 

The client is a root entry from the ELO repository depending on the parameters and configuration. A

document view component is used. If the root entry is a folder, users can navigate within this

folder and view all child entries of the folder.

A number of ELO functions are available for the current entry depending on the configuration. Users

can search for entries from ELO (including outside of the root entry) to create a reference to

individual search results within the root entry.

Document view 

The document view is a standard component of the ELO Integration Client. It shows the content of

an entry, any configured ELO apps (e.g. Business Solution ELO Knowledge), the form (configurable),

and the feed (configurable). The content is displayed depending on the entry. For folders, a list of

the folder content (child entries) is shown, while different viewers are used to show documents,

depending on their type (web viewer, e-mail viewer, text viewer, image viewer, WOPI viewer). If

the document has a preview document, it is also offered through an image viewer. If the document

has full text, the text viewer is offered.

Viewers 

Web viewer: Loads the document in an embedded iFrame. Different plug-ins are used to

display the document depending on the browser and document type.

E-mail viewer: e-mail files (.msg, .eml) are shown by the e-mail viewer. It requests the

contents of the e-mail from the server and displays them.

Text viewer: the text contents of the file are displayed. In the viewer, you can change the font

size.

Image viewer: the contents of the file are queried and shown page by page as an image. This

viewer allows you to switch between pages and scale the current image to different sizes.

WOPI viewer: If you have installed the ELO Interface for Microsoft Office Online (ELOimo), the

document preview can also show Office documents and PDF files using Microsoft Office

Online.
