Textreader (gen. 2)

General 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) extracts text from documents of specific formats, which is the basis for the

full text search.

It also coverts documents into PDF format. The PDF files are displayed in ELO clients as document

previews.

Another task is to provide OCR for the ELO Indexserver.

Information

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) is a new product and replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),

ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr) starting with version

ELO 21.4.

Please note

To allow ELO Textreader (gen. 2) to process documents containing special Microsoft fonts in

a Linux operating system, you must install these fonts in advance. The installation process

varies according to the Linux distribution you are using. You can find more information about

this on the Internet if you search for the keyword ttf-mscorefonts.

Architecture 

Standalone application 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) starts as a standalone application and does not require a Tomcat server.

The ELO Server Setup installs it as a service in the operating system. It can also be executed from

the command line via Java code. You will find a corresponding shell script in the bin folder of the

download package.

Cluster capacity 

Multiple instances of ELO Textreader (gen. 2) can be clustered with a load balancer. The load

balancer must ensure that requests for a specific conversion job reach the same instance, so you

need to configure it for sticky sessions. The ELO Indexserver assumes that the load balancer

implements sticky sessions with HTTP cookies. It remembers the cookies transmitted from the

server and sends them in all requests belonging to the conversion job.

This is a configuration example of a load balancer with the Apache2 web server:

3 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



The Apache2 modules proxy, proxy_http, proxy_balancer, and lbmethod_byrequests must be

enabled.

Supported file types 

The file types listed below can be processed by ELO Textreader (gen. 2).

6 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Configuration 

The configuration is done in a file consisting of name-value pairs called config.properties in the

configuration directory of the ELO installation.

Important

Only ELO Textreader (gen. 2) and the responsible administrators may access the

configuration file.

Resource requirements 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) consumes significant CPU time and hard disk space for conversion

operations in addition to a large amount of RAM. Resource requirements can best be monitored and

controlled when run in a separate environment (e.g. VM or Docker container). You should allocate

several GB of RAM and several GB of disk space for production environments, especially because

of the resource-intensive OCR process (see com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.workerCount).

Configuration file example

7 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



ELO Textreader (gen. 2) accepts requests from all computers by default. This entails the risk

of a DoS attack. With a firewall rule, you can allow requests from servers running an ELO

Indexserver only.

URL of ELO Textreader (gen. 2) in the ELO Indexserver configuration 

You must enter the URL of ELO Textreader (gen. 2) as the textreaderUrl option in the ELO

Indexserver configuration. For more instructions, see the ELO Indexserver options page (in the ELO

Application Server, select /ix-<Name> > Login > Configure Options > Help).

If multiple ELO Indexservers are active for the repository, they negotiate among themselves which

one will perform conversion. If only one specific ELO Indexserver is to be responsible for this, enter

the option value only for the instance name of this ELO Indexserver. However, this is only

worthwhile if converting a large number of documents. It is not usually necessary to run an ELO

Indexserver solely to manage the conversion process.

TCP port for HTTP 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) accepts HTTP requests on this TCP port. If only encrypted connections

should be allowed, leave out this value and only enter https.port.

TCP port for HTTPS 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) accepts HTTPS requests on this TCP port. If only unencrypted connections

should be used, leave out this value and enter https.port. If an HTTPS port is specified, the 

https.keystore, https.keystoreType, and https.keystorePassword settings must also be specified.

TCP host 

Server name or server address on which ELO Textreader (gen. 2) is running and whose TCP ports

accept connections. With the value 0.0.0.0, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) listens to all server addresses.

Default value: localhost.

_ALL | textreaderUrl | http://localhost:9060/tr

http.port=9060

https.port=9063

http.host=localhost

8 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Certificate file 

File path to the certificate file. This is only required for HTTPS connections.

Type of certificate file 

Type of certificate file: PKCS12, PKCS11, JKS. This is only required for HTTPS connections.

Password of certificate file 

The certificate file is protected with this password. This is only required for HTTPS connections.

Manage the conversion process 

Instance name 

You can install multiple ELO Textreader instances by using a load balancer to group them under a

single address. Each instance must have a unique name. The name should consist of the characters

A-Z, a-z, and 0-9.

Information

If you run a load balancer in front of multiple text readers, make sure that it is configured for

sticky sessions.

Parallel conversion 

It is possible to perform multiple conversion operations simultaneously. The more CPU cores the

server has, the more parallel operations can be performed. Because the CPU pauses until the data

is read or written, the number of operations can be higher than the number of CPU cores. Default

value: 10

https.keystore

https.keystoreType

https.keystorePassword

com.elo.tr2.textreader.instanceName=Instance1

com.elo.tr2.textreader.maxWorkers=10

9 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Working directory 

Temporary files are stored in this directory. Default value: Temporary directory of the environment.

Important

Only ELO Textreader (gen. 2) needs full access in this directory. The directory must not be

visible to users. No other programs need access to the directory.

Information

Directory separators have to be entered with a double backslash in Windows. Example: C:\

\ELO\\data\\textreader....

Minimum free disk space 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) will abort processing if there are less than the specified amount of MB free

in the working directory. Because built-in third-party components do not take this setting into

account, the value should be chosen generously. Default value: 100 MB.

Maximum processing time 

Processing of a document will be aborted if it takes longer than the specified number of seconds.

For container documents, the specification also includes the processing time of all documents in

the container. However, not all conversion operations in ELO Textreader (gen. 2) can be aborted

after exactly this amount of time. Some processes must run at least until parts of them are

completed. Default value: 600 s.

Wait time for result 

A conversion request waits the maximum specified number of seconds for the result. If it is

available within this time, the result is returned. If the conversion takes longer, the ELO Indexserver

receives a handle with which it can repeatedly request the result (polling). This request waits for

the number of seconds specified here. Default value: 10 s.

com.elo.tr2.textreader.workDir=/tmp/textreader

com.elo.tr2.textreader.minFreeDiskSpaceMB=100

com.elo.tr2.textreader.maxFileProcessingSeconds=600

com.elo.tr2.textreader.waitForResultSeconds=10

10 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



User authentication for status page 

These settings specify the authentication credentials for the status page. The status page opens in

a reduced state by default. Additional information can only be viewed after logging on.

Authentication for client application 

The value of this configuration entry should be left empty if a license key is available (new as of

ELO 21.4). Otherwise, you need to enter *.

The ELO Textreader (gen. 2) functions may only be used by ELO programs. This is due to licensing

requirements of several commercial components that are integrated in ELO Textreader. Especially

in the case of cloud installations, you should pay attention to the license terms if an ELO Textreader

instance is made publicly available to multiple clients on the Internet.

This is why ELO Textreader (gen. 2) requires an authentication key in every request. If a license key

is stored in the ELO installation, the public part of the license key is transmitted as authentication.

The public part of the key is checked when the request is sent to the ELO Indexserver on 

license.elo.com.

For installations with a license file instead of a license key, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) must not be

publicly accessible. It is the responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that only ELO

programs can access the ELO Textreader, e.g. through an appropriate firewall configuration.

Currently, only the ELO Indexserver requires access to the text reader.

Map file extension to converter 

With the default settings, the converters provided in ELO Textreader (gen. 2) are already mapped to

all file extensions that they can process. However, this mapping is not unique for PDF files. This

setting can be used to specify which converter should be used to process the file type.

Check uploaded files for malicious content 

com.elo.tr2.textreader.authUser=admin

com.elo.tr2.textreader.authPassword=geheim

com.elo.tr2.textreader.authKeys=

com.elo.tr2.textreader.fileType.<file-extension>=<converter-id>

com.elo.tr2.textreader.fileType.pdf=com.elo.tr2.conv.pdf

com.elo.tr2.textreader.verifyFileUploadCommand=clamdscan --fdpass $1

11 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



You can execute a command line that invokes a virus scanner to check uploaded files for malicious

content. In the call line, the placeholder $1 specifies the position at which the uploaded file is

inserted. The command must return the exit code 0 if the file is OK. Any other value will be read as

an error.

Whitelist for file types 

If you only want certain file types to be processed, they can be specified as a semicolon separated

list of file extensions or content types (mime types). If the setting is not made or is left empty, all

file types are allowed.

Exclusion list for file types 

If you do not want certain file types to be processed, they can be specified as a semicolon

separated list of file extensions or content types (mime types). If the setting is not made or is left

empty, all file types are allowed.

OCR converter settings 

Maximum file size 

Maximum size of a file sent to the OCR service. This is only relevant with 

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.ocrUrls. Default value: 10 MB.

OCR component installation directory 

If you want ELO Textreader (gen. 2) to load the OCR component, this value specifies the installation

directory of the OCR component.

Information

Directory separators have to be entered with a double backslash in Windows. Example: C:\

\ELO\\prog\\ocr10.

com.elo.tr2.textreader.allowedFileTypes=txt;pdf;docx;xlsx

com.elo.tr2.textreader.disallowedFileTypes=exe;bin;dat

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.maxFileSizeMB=10

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.instDir=/opt/elo/prog/ocr10

12 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Working directory 

This specifies the working directory where temporary files are stored. This is only relevant with 

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.instDir.

Information

Directory separators have to be entered with a double backslash in Windows. Example: C:\

\ELO\\data\\textreader\\ocr-conv.

Number of OCR worker processes 

Number of worker processes that will be started for OCR. At least 1 GB must be provided by the

environment. The number of workers multiplied by 400 MB RAM is added to this. This is only

relevant with com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.instDir.

Minimum size for documents 

OCR is only performed for files that might have relevant content based on their size. For example,

OCR should not be performed on icons because they are not expected to contain text. Default

value: 5 KB.

Timeout for a document page 

The analysis of a page should not take longer than the specified number of seconds. This value is

multiplied by the number of pages to calculate the maximum total duration. The analysis of a

document will be aborted if it takes longer than the total duration. Default value: 600 s.

Timeout for a document 

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.workDir=/tmp/textreader/ocr-conv

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.workerCount=4

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.minFileSizeKB=5

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.pageTimeoutSeconds=600

com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.fileTimeoutSeconds=600

13 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



The analysis of a document should not take longer than the specified number of seconds. If the

timeout is exceeded, the process is aborted. Default value: 600 s.

Foreground and background processing 

Foreground and background tasks are managed with separate task pools. This value specifies how

the com.elo.tr2.textreader.maxWorkers and com.elo.tr2.conv.ocr.workerCount are distributed. If

you set 60, for example, 60 percent of these settings are reserved for background tasks. The

default value 0 means that all tasks are treated equally as background tasks.

Settings for generating preview files 

Disable preview generation 

A preview is automatically created for each document added to the full text. If you do not want a

preview to be generated, for example to save storage space, you will have to make the following

setting in the ELO Indexserver options, and not in the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) configuration file:

Instance Name Value

_ALL previewGenerationDisabled true

Information

Previews are helpful for displaying documents in the ELO Web Client if they cannot be

shown in the browser in their original format.

com.elo.tr2.conv.all.reservedForForegroundPercent=60

14 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Mode of operation 

The ELO Indexserver FT plug-in is responsible for finding the documents to be processed. It

searches for new conversion jobs in the vtdocs control table of the repository database

approximately every 10 seconds.

If multiple ELO Indexservers are active for the repository and are responsible according to the

configuration, they communicate with one another so that only one server executes these requests.

The documents that are found are sent to ELO Textreader (gen. 2) via HTTP/S.

If ELO Textreader (gen. 2) delivers the text content for a document within the default value of 10

seconds, it is returned as a response in the HTTP/S call. Otherwise, the ELO Indexserver first

receives a handle with which it repeatedly requests the text content at intervals of a few seconds.

A preview file in PDF format is generated along with the full text content. The ELO Indexserver

stores both these files in the repository along with the document.

Information

A preview file is only generated for documents that have been added to the full text search.

The ELO Indexserver also calls ELO Textreader (gen. 2) to process OCR tasks. Therefore, a separate

connection to the OCR service is not required.

Information

Unlike the previous ELO Textreader, the connection is established by the ELO Indexserver.

This allows you to use ELO Textreader (gen. 2) in different installations without having to list

the URLs of the ELO Indexservers in its configuration.

Conversion for foreground and background tasks 

To prioritize conversion tasks triggered by user actions, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) manages separate

task pools for foreground and background tasks. In the configuration, you can specify the allocation

of total resources to the two task pools. In addition, foreground tasks are executed with a higher

priority (Java thread priority) than the background tasks.

The ELO Indexserver treats queries from the ELO Java Client, ELO Web Client, ELO Desktop Client,

or the ELO apps for iOS and Android as foreground tasks. This currently only relates to OCR tasks.

Service tasks (e.g. from ELO Automation Services) such as full text and preview processing, and

OCR, are considered background tasks.

15 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



Converter 

ELO Textreader (gen. 2) delegates tasks to internal converter modules, which are selected

according to document type and target type (text content or PDF preview). Temporary files may be

created in the working directory in the process. These are deleted after conversion.

If the document being converted additionally contains documents (e.g. e-mails with attachments),

there is a child folder for each of the contained documents. The conversion process is only

completed when all contained documents have been converted. Afterwards, the result can be

retrieved from the ELO Indexserver.

Logging 

With the default settings, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) writes three log files:

tr2.log: Log of processing steps

tr2-ocr.log: Log of OCR processing

tr2-report.log: For each conversion job, one line with information about success or error

The log outputs are configured in the logback.xml file of the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) configuration

directory. You will find information on the file syntax here.

Every time ELO Textreader (Gen. 2) is called, it sends unique call tags that identify all associated

actions. Extract from tr2.log:

In this example, the call identifier IX1-1355106364585954729 is transmitted for the HTTP request. It

consists of the instance name of the ELO Indexserver IX1 and the random number 

1355106364585954729. There are two conversion tasks in the call, tagged 

1355106364585954729-685511-1-FT and 1355106364585954729-685511-2-PV. They consist of the

random number from the HTTP request, the object ID of the document 685511, a consecutive

number 1 or 2, and the abbreviation FT for full text and PV for preview.

You can also see from the extract that a document was sent in XLSX format and has 150639 bytes: 

Begin convert [file-extension/xlsx, #150639].

The conversion to PDF format was completed after 1390 ms and returned a file size of 164841

bytes: [1390] Converted=SUCCESS, in=[file-extension/xlsx, #150639], out=[application/pdf,

#164841].

Use the Test link to open a test page for converting a document.

19 ELO Textreader (gen. 2)



After selecting a file, you can use the Send button to upload the document to ELO Textreader (gen.

2) and convert it. The result will appear in the same browser window. If conversion takes longer,

you will get a new page with a link to get the result.

Logging level 

You can select the logging level in the drop-down menu. The Debug setting should only be used for

a short period for troubleshooting purposes because a lot of data is written to the report files over

time.
