2 ELO mobile apps



Basics 

With the ELO app, you can access your company's ELO repository using a mobile device. The app

offers quick access to your documents and all associated details. You can capture and file

documents while out of the office and search for information in ELO.

The ELO app does not replace the desktop version of ELO, but is designed to complement it. To get

the most out of the ELO app, you should already be familiar with the basic functions of ELO

software as well as your device.

The ELO app is optimized for use on tablets in landscape mode. This manual explains how to use

the app with a tablet. It may look different on your device.

Installation and getting started 

Requirements 

The following requirements apply for the installation and use of the ELO app:

Internet. For more information, refer to the ELO Web Client Internet Access developer

documentation.

Active Internet connection for unrestricted functionality. 

Please note

HTTPS is essential for secure communication, as sensitive data is sent over the network.

Without SSL/TLS encryption, third parties could intercept this data.

Install app 

You will find the ELO app in the Google Play Store.

Method

Tap Install to begin installation.

Result

The app is installed on your device automatically.

restricted functions without write rights. To create a demo account at a later point in time, tap the 

CREATE DEMO ACCOUNT button in the action bar of the Configuration dialog box.

To access your company repository, you need to set up your ELO user account in the ELO app. Tap 

Log on with existing account. You can find more information in the section Add account.

Language 

The ELO app automatically uses your device's language settings. If the ELO app does not support

your language, it uses English as the default.

User interface 

This documentation describes the user interface in landscape mode on a tablet. It may look

different on your device.

The user interface may differ depending on the work area and the function being used.

Layout 

The user interface is divided into two main areas: the list view and the viewer pane.

Metadata 

Before you can enter metadata for new folders or documents in the ELO app, your administrator

has to create a form and link it to the metadata form.

Information

If a form has not been assigned to the metadata form, the ELO app loads a default form with

the fields Short name, Document date, and Extra text. If a metadata form contains

mandatory fields, your administrator will have to create a form and link it to the metadata

form so it can be selected in the ELO app.

Enter metadata on filing: If you create a new folder or add a file, you can enter metadata for the

entries directly. There are different options for entering metadata for new folders and documents.

Tap to open the following options:

Always use the form: If this option is enabled, you will always see a metadata dialog box

when filing documents. The form assigned to the metadata form is used to enter the

metadata. If a form has not been assigned, the system uses the default form with the Short

text, Document date, and Extra text fields.

Only for metadata forms with form: If this option is enabled, the metadata form will only

appear if the selected metadata form is linked to a form. If a form has not been assigned, the

new entry is automatically filed with the default form. The default form contains the Short

text, Document date, and Extra text fields.

Do not enter metadata: If this option is enabled, no metadata dialog box opens. The new

entry is automatically filed with the default form. The default form contains the Short text, 

Document date, and Extra text fields.

metadata. If a form has not been assigned, the system uses the default form with the Short

text, Document date, and Extra text fields.

Only for metadata forms with form: If this option is enabled, the metadata form will only

appear if the selected metadata form is linked to a form. If a form has not been assigned, the

new entry is automatically filed with the default form. The default form contains the Short

text, Document date, and Extra text fields.

repository values is loaded right from the app. All you have to do is replace the variables with the

relevant data.

The Automatic data set filing dialog box closes. Your changes have been applied.

Requirements 

To work with data sets, you need a metadata form with the corresponding settings and a specific

form.

Metadata form 

When submitting data with the ELO app, all data is saved to a metadata form. Create a separate

metadata form for each form you want to enter data with. To do so, use the ELO Administration

Console.

The layout of the metadata form depends on the data you want to submit. Use the metadata form

to define:

The fields for submitting data

The filing path for the data sets (filing definition) you created

Whether you can add one or multiple files to the data set (form type)

Fields 

Add a field and the associated group for each data field that you want to include in the form. These

fields are linked to the form. The user enters data to the fields via the form in the app.

Filing definition 

Create a filing definition so that the data sets can be uploaded to ELO. The data sets cannot be filed

to the repository without a filing definition.

Form type 

The form type specifies whether the data set is created as a document or as a folder. You can select

the following settings:

Usage > Folders: If this option is enabled, data sets are created as folders. You can attach multiple

files to a data set. However, you do not have to attach a file. Attachments are filed with the Basic

entry metadata form.

Usage > Documents: If this option is enabled, data sets are created as documents. You must attach

a file. You cannot attach more than one file.

If both options are selected, the conditions for the Usage – Documents option will apply.

Form 

You need a specific form to create a data set. You create this form using the ELO form designer in

the ELO Administration Console or in the ELO Java Client.

Information

For detailed information on forms, refer to the ELO Java Client Workflow manual.

Please note

Data set forms are intended for offline use. This means you cannot use functions that

require a connection to the ELO Indexserver, such as ELOas rules or dynamic keyword lists.

Please note

A data set form must be created as a separate template. Data set forms must not be

divided into tab groups.

A data set form must meet the following criteria:

Form name: The name of the form must follow this pattern: offline_<NAME>. Replace <NAME> as

required.

Template: The form requires a template. The name of the template must follow this pattern: 

main_<NAME>. Replace <NAME> as required.

The names of the form and the template do not need to match.

Connecting metadata forms 

You need to link the template to a suitable metadata form (see above).

Method

Open the template in the ELO form designer.

Open the Metadata form drop-down menu under Global form settings.

Select the metadata form you require.

did not transfer the data to the client. Restart the module and the client. Afterwards,

click Refresh in the form designer.

Tap Apply to apply your changes.

Alternative: The changes are also applied when you save the template.

Result

The name and the ID of the selected metadata form are grayed out in the Metadata form field.

Linking fields 

To ensure that the data is applied to the metadata of the data set, you need to link each field form

to a metadata field.

Link to a field as follows:

Open the template in the ELO form designer.

Click the line of the form that you want to link to a field.

Open the Variable name drop-down menu under Properties of the selected cell.
