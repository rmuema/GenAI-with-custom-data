2 Business Solution ELO Visitor



Basics

Roles and groups 

User roles 

User roles control the availability of actions in visitor management. The corresponding functions

are available on the ribbon to users in this group.

Front desk staff: sol.visitor.roles.Reception 

Front desk staff has access to all visitor management actions. They can register and check in

visitors and groups, and have access to report functions.

Involved employees: sol.visitor.roles.Employees 

Company employees can be granted the right to pre-register visitors and visitor groups. Users in

this ELO group (role) are given access to pre-registration actions.

Self-service: sol.visitor.roles.SelfService 

Individual company employees can be granted the right to use self-services. This refers to the

actions Self check-in and Self check-out.

Configuration: sol.visitor.roles.Administration 

Individual company employees can be given the right to edit the contract management

configuration. This applies to the custom configuration under //Administration//Business Solutions

Custom//visitor//Configuration as well as the configuration interface in the ELO Administration

Console.

Groups and permissions 

The standard version of the ELO visitor management solution features a number of groups that are

used for selection lists and permissions concepts.

Locations/branches: sol.visitor.Locations 

A user group that contains the branches for visitor management. A branch should be represented

by a group whose members are all people with the corresponding rights.

You will find more information on the permissions of individual locations or branches in the

chapters Branches and Permissions to visitors and groups.

Welcome screens: sol.visitorWelcomeScreens 

Welcome screens require access to visitor data to be able to display it. A group containing the

users that can check in at the screen should be created for each screen.

Information

By default, a new account named Welcome Screen is created and assigned to this group.

The account password should be changed after installation.

For more information, refer to the chapter Welcome screen.

Signature devices: sol.visitor.SignatureDevice 

Signature devices require access to visitor data to be able to edit visitor documents.

Each signature device requires a separate ELO account. This account can be selected when

requesting a signature. A signature request is then submitted to this account.

Information

By default, a new account named Signature Device is created and assigned to this group.

The account password should be changed after installation.

For more information, refer to the Request signature and Sign documents chapters.

Security check: sol.visitor.roles.Security 

In security-critical areas, you may have to perform a security check. Members of this group belong

to the internal security department.

For more information, refer to the Security check – basics chapter.

General information/procedure for updates 

Single actions can be enabled individually for users and groups. For this, individual rights have to

be assigned for the corresponding action configuration (definition). When updating to a new

version, these rights are reset since they are contained in the base package.

The default groups above are created during installation. It is therefore recommended not to

rename or delete the groups. If the standardized naming of these groups presents an issue, you can

remove the Visible in user lists flag for them.
