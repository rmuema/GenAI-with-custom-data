File invoice and add documents

This chapter explains what options you have for filing an invoice and adding documents later on.

File invoice

Information

You can file one invoice or multiple invoices simultaneously to ELO from your Intray. Filing invoices

initiates a workflow that circulates the invoice to the correct departments in the company.

The following functions are available:

File invoice

File invoice with attachments

Invoices are either filed to a separate, automatically created folder or as a document.

If both functions are available, the invoice is filed to a separate folder.

Information

How invoices are filed depends on administrative settings.

Process: File invoice

In the Intray, select the invoice or invoices you want to file.

To select multiple invoices, press and hold the CTRL or SHIFT keys while selecting invoices with the

Process: File invoice with attachments

In the Intray, select the invoice with attachments you want to file.

To select an invoice and its attachments, press and hold the CTRL or SHIFT keys while selecting the

documents with the mouse. The document you select first gives the folder its name and should be

the invoice.

Information

This function does not allow you to file multiple invoices separately at the same time. All

selected documents are filed to the same folder.
