You know your application was registered if it has its own application ID.

Now grant API permissions to your application via Microsoft Graph.8.

Under Delegated permissions, you now need to grant the app the following permissions:

Channel.ReadBasic.All

Team.ReadBasic.All

TeamsTab.Create

You can find the required permissions with the help of the search bar and enable them by

Host the web app 

The web app is a purely static website you will find in the www folder. This means it can be hosted

on any web server, such as the ELO application server, as a static website in Microsoft Azure, or

using popular web hosting providers. It requires HTTPS encryption.

Configuration 

Before you upload the web app, you need to make some changes to the file www/authConfig.js in

the www folder in the file system.

This document is a JavaScript file. You can open it with the program Visual Studio Code, for

example.

Make the following changes to the authConfig.js file in the main folder:

clientId: Enter your application ID (client) here (see the chapter Register in Azure, screenshot

for step 7).

tenantId: Enter your directory ID (tenant) here. This is located directly under Application ID

(client) (see the chapter Register in Azure, screenshot for step 7).

Hosting on the ELO Application Server 

If you want to host the web app on the ELO Application Server (Tomcat), copy the folder www to 

<elo-tomcat-dir>/webapps and rename it (e.g. to "teams").

Test 

Once the web app has been hosted and the Azure app has been registered correctly, you can test

the app.

1. 

2. 

const authConfig = {

  cliendId: "<azure-client-id>",

  tenantId: "<azure-tenant-id>",

}

Go to the address where the browser is hosted. Now you can log on to the web app with your

Microsoft account and integrate any website into Microsoft Teams.

ELO Integration Client 

ELO for Microsoft Teams requires the ELO Integration Client. This is included in the ELO 20 and ELO

21 standard packages. If you are using ELO 12, you need to activate a corresponding license for the

ELO Integration Client.

Install the ELO Integration Client and adjust the configuration as follows:

The ELO Integration Client configuration is stored in the ELO repository under:

//Administration//ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.Client

If there is no configuration here, you need to create a corresponding file. You can make the

following entries in an empty JSON file and save the JSON object in the ELO repository at the path

named above.

As described in the ELO Integration Client documentation, you can use the configuration in the JSON

object to determine which functions will be available in the ELO Integration Client. More

information about the range of possible functions in the ELO Integration Client is available on the

ELO SupportWeb.

Microsoft Teams uses the system parameter teams. You need to add a configuration for this

parameter.

Information

You can find more detailed information about the ELO Integration Client in its main

documentation.

Example: 

Once you have completed these steps, you can check if the ELO Integration Client is configured and

working correctly by going to the following URL:

{

  "teams": {

    "folderMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E31)",

    "documentMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E30)",

    "newDocVersFct": true,

    "saveDocFct": true,

    "gotoFct": true

  }

}

Client plug-in 

To complete the installation and create a button in the ELO Java Client and ELO Web Client that

allows you to share your documents and folders with Microsoft Teams straight from ELO, you need

to store a plug-in (ELOinst file) in the Java Client and adjust the configuration accordingly.

Install 

Install the plug-in simply by dragging the file integration.teams_1.0.eloinst to the ELO Java Client.

Drag the file custom_integration.teams_1.0.eloinst to the ELO Java Client as well.

Configure 

You will find the plug-in configuration file (integration.teams.config) in ELO under:

Administration // Business Solutions Custom // integration.teams // Configuration //

teamsUrl: Enter the URL where you installed the app (see Register in Azure; step 4, or 2.2 Tomcat:

Host the web app on the ELO Application Server).

By default, the following URL is used in Microsoft Teams:

12 ELO for Microsoft



If the internal ELOix URL doesn't work (e.g. due to plain HTTP) and the ELOix or the ELO Integration

Client can be reached via (HTTPS) proxy, you can also overwrite this address as follows:

Test 

After you restart the client, the Integrate in Microsoft Teams button should appear in the menu.

<ELOix-url>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/wf/apps/app/elo.integration.Client/?useSSO=true&system=teams&GUID

{

      "teamsUrl": "...",

      "eloUrl": "URL-that-will be used-in-microsoft-teams-with-{{guid}}"

   }
