ELO Java Client with additional components 

If you select the Installation Program for ELO Java Client (Windows) with Additional Components

menu item, the Make AIO Installer Structure program opens. By default, the program selects a

directory shared as ELO JC AIO Installer on the local computer. If you attempt to start copying files

and the directory does not exist, you will get an error message.

Select a directory on the local computer or network.

Click Start Copy to copy the files.

After all files have been copied successfully, you will see the status message Copying

finished.

Click End and navigate to this directory in a file browser.

You will see several files and folders in this directory that allow you to customize the installer

for the ELO Java Client. Immediately after copying the files, you will see an .EXE file that

starts with EloJC.

1. 

2. 

3. 

12 Client administration



Run the EXE file.

The ELO ECM Suite Client Installation window opens.

This installs the ELO Java Client along with all available optional components by default.

Information

The default entries for installation directory, profile name, and ELO Indexserver URL are just

examples of valid entries and usually need to be adjusted for your specific requirements.

Although you can select or clear all options in this window, you can also modify the default settings

by changing the name and parameters of the .EXE file. The latter option is particularly useful for

network rollouts. The following is a list of possible installation options.

13 Client administration



Installation directory 

The ELO Java Client is installed to this directory when you run the program on a local computer. You

can change the default directory by specifying INSTALLDIR="<path>" as the command line

parameter when you run the file.

Profile name 

This is the name of the profile that the user sees when logging on to the repository with the ELO

Java Client. You can enter any name here, but it is recommended to specify a name that helps the

user identify the repository they are about to use.

Define the profile name by entering a text string to the space between the last underscore and the

.EXE in the file name.

ELO Indexserver URL 

This is the URL to the ELO Indexserver for your repository. Change the default URL by altering the

file name from ...http_localhost_9090_elo... to ...<http(s)>_<server name>_<port>_<repository

name>.

Select what you want to install: The ELO OCR service performs text recognition on image files,

usually from the ELO Intray. The TIFF and PDF printer options install printer drivers that allow

documents to be printed from or to ELO in each of the respective output formats. To select or

remove each of these features from the AIO installer by default, change the .EXE in the part after

the first underscore and add or remove J (Java Client), C (OCR service), T (TIFF printer), or P (PDF

printer).

Select the programs you want to link to ELO with the macro: In this area, define which programs in

Windows you want to install an ELO add-in to. The add-in provides you with additional in-program

buttons that send documents directly to the ELO repository or Intray. To change the defaults,

change the .EXE file name in the same part as above and add or remove W (Microsoft Word macro), 

E (Microsoft Excel macro), I (Microsoft PowerPoint macro), and O (Microsoft Outlook macro).

Configuration with file name 

You can configure the AIO program by renaming the installation file. This offers several options for a

rollout installation with predefined values.

Please note Refer to the _Readme.txt_ file for instructions on configuration with

the file name. This file explains the various options that are available and the

correct structure of the file name.

14 Client administration



Example 

The order of the flags selected for the all-in-one installer does not matter.

Example: The file name ...DWCJPE... selects the same options as ...JWDCEP....

The file name must have the following format:

<prefix>_<language>_<flags>_<http(s)>_<server name or IP>_<port>_<repository name>_<profile

name>.exe

15 Client administration



If you make an error in the file name, you will see an error message. If you click OK, the installer

will still open, allowing you to perform a manual installation.

Terminal server operation 

It is also possible to run the ELO Java Client in a terminal server environment.

Memory 

Each instance of the Java Client is assigned 1 GB of RAM by default. This may require excessive

amounts of system RAM in terminal server environments. It is possible to reduce this value to 500

MB in most environments without drawbacks.

To do so, open the Windows Registry and search for ELOJavaClientw.exe.

The registry key where this is stored also contains the parameter -Xmx1000m.

Change this value to -Xmx500m.

Please note

Do not change the memory settings for the ELO Java Client without first testing performance

with different document types in the actual repository. Reducing this value to less than 500

MB is not recommended.

macOS 

If you are installing the ELO Java Client on macOS, you need to consider the following information.

Please note

In rare cases, the macOS Gatekeeper prevents the execution of the ELO Java Client or

functions such as PDF conversion even if a signature is valid. Apple sets a quarantine flag on

the app, which can be removed with the following command:

1. 

2. 

sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ELOClient/ELOClient.app

16 Client administration



Java Runtime Environment 

The ELO Java Client for macOS includes a Java Runtime Environment package. This means you

don't need to install the Java Runtime Environment separately.

Installation 

The installation files are provided as a disk image file (DMG). If you downloaded the installation

package from the ELO SupportWeb, the DMG file comes in a ZIP file. If you have already copied the 

InstallELOClient DMG file to your Mac, continue reading from the Start installation section.

Information

The new repository is now also stored as an entry in the Windows registry under 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Javasoft\Prefs\ELO Digital Office\eloenterprise. In Linux

and macOS, you will find the ELO Java Client profiles in the home/

<username>/.java/.userPrefs/elo digital office/eloenterprise/prefs.xml file. The

numbers at the end of the entries are incremented automatically. They correspond to the

number of existing repositories.

Registry entries for the ELO Java Client 

Create a string named archive1 and a string value of the ELO Indexserver URL with the forward

slashes (/) replaced by backslashes(\). The value could read:

Next, create a second string named name1 and enter the name of the profile into the field. Capital

letters must have a forward slash, e.g. /E/L/O repository. There are additional rules for special

characters. If you need them in the repository name, create a profile in the ELO Java Client and

check the result in the registry.

You can add profiles in the same way: repository2/name2, repository3/name3, and so on. You can

Translation 

This chapter describes options for translating interface texts that are not included in the standard

language package.

Translation files 

ELO provides a number of options for translating texts with the help of translation files. This section

explains how you can do this. 

You can use variables from translation files in:

Names of fields in metadata

Names of forms in metadata

Keyword lists

Node names in workflows

Name when forwarding workflows

In scripts and forms

The translation files are stored as the file type PROPERTIES. The following conditions apply: 

Character encoding: UTF-8

Path in ELO: Administration//Localization//custom

One for each language: A properties file with the corresponding country code (de, en, fr, etc.)

The following example describes how to work with translation files using translated fields in the

metadata. In principle, this method works for the other points listed above.

You will find more information on using translations in workflows and forms in the ELO workflow

documentation.

Example 

In the following example, we use a metadata form named Photo.

Method

Create a text file. You can enter any name for this file. However, you must add an underscore

between the end of the name and the language abbreviation and use the file extension

.properties. In our example, this is:

masksAndFields_en.properties

For each field, enter a variable and the name of the field in the respective language. You must

use the following format:

<prefix>.<variable>=<text>

Prefix: You can choose any prefix you like. However, you should use the same prefix for

one specific purpose.

Variable: You can choose any variable you like. In this example, we use the group name

of the corresponding field to make it easier to map.

Text: The text is displayed as the name of the field. The language should correspond to

the respective language abbreviation.

For each language, create a copy of the first properties file with the corresponding language

abbreviation. Otherwise, the name of the file must match that of the first file. In our example,

this is:

masksAndFields_de.properties

Replace the texts in the corresponding language.

file without the language abbreviation.

Open the ELO Administration Console.

Go to the Field templates area.

Select a field of the selected form.

Translation table 

You can use the translation table to translate interface texts such as the short names of entries. 

The following instructions are an example that can be applied to other scenarios.

Example 

This example explains how to translate the short names of folders.

Requirement

The respective entries must have been filed with a metadata form in which the Translate short

name option is enabled.

84 Client administration



The option must have been set globally in the ELO Administration Console under Metadata forms

and fields > Entry options). If you enable the option later, you must set the option manually for

existing entries in the client using the Options tab in the metadata form.

Method

Open the metadata of the folder whose short name you want to translate.

Copy the short name of the folder.

Open the translation table (Organize tab > System > Translation table).

In the translation table, automatically recognized texts are listed in the system language.

Information

You can change the sort order of the table using the table headers. However, you can

only enter new terms if the table has not been sorted manually and there is no

triangle icon next to a column header.

Scroll down until you reach the last entry in the table.

Information

It is not always possible to translate merged strings. For example, if you want to

translate the short name January 01, you cannot just enter January in the translation

table. You need to enter the whole string.

Enter the translation you want in the column with the respective language abbreviation.

Click OK.

Result

You have entered a translation for the short name. As soon as you change the language, the

translated texts are displayed.

Change storage location for user data 

The storage location and structure of the client user data can be configured differently from the

default using the ELO_USER_HOME environment variable. Keep in mind that these should still remain

on a local drive. Fast access to files in temp or doccache are especially important for client

performance.

Since ELO 12.04, the Intray and In use work areas can be stored separately using the variables 

ELO_USER_INTRAY and ELO_USER_CHECKOUT. This ensures that there is significantly less impact on

network path performance, for example.

Configuration 

In order to configure the environment variables, the following items need to be taken into account:

The name of the environment variable must be ELO_USER_HOME, ELO_USER_INTRAY or 

ELO_USER_CHECKOUT.

The variable should always be defined in the user area of the environment variables and not

in the machine area.

The variables must always be written in uppercase.

The variables must begin and end with a % sign.

You should ensure that the resolved file paths do exceed the maximum length allowed in

Windows of 255 characters.

If the environment variable is defined in a different way than by using the interface in

Windows, please ensure that the registry entry is of the type REG_EXPAND_SZ since otherwise it

will not be possible to resolve the corresponding variable.

Information

If the environment variable is defined in a different way than by using the interface in

Windows, please ensure that the registry entry is of the type REG_EXPAND_SZ since otherwise

it will not be possible to resolve the corresponding variable.

Variable: %APPDATA%\ELO Digital Office GmbH\%ELOPROFILENAME%\%ELOUSERID%\

If Mr. Meyer (Windows user name: Meyer) has connected with the ELO user Administrator (user

ID=0) with the profile DEMOSERVER02, then the environment variable would look like this:

C:\Users\Meier\AppData\Roaming\ELO Digital Office GmbH\DEMOSERVER02\0\

Note: Due to this uniqueness, the user name should not be used for the file paths. If the user name

is changed later, the user will no longer be able to find any files that it checked out. The specific

structure for the ELO Java Client will be created within this folder.

Important note: As soon as the environment variable has been defined, the ELO Java Client will

access the new checkout directory. The old files will no longer be displayed. You must therefore

ensure that all users have checked in their documents before the variables are defined, as

otherwise the files must be manually moved.

ELO Barcode

Getting started 

This section contains information on how to set up ELO Barcode. Follow the links for more detailed

information about the individual steps.

The ELO Barcode module automatically reads barcode information, which makes it easier to file

documents and enter metadata. You will find an overview of the supported barcode types in the 

Table of supported barcode types chapter.

Activate license 

ELO Barcode is automatically installed along with the ELO Java Client. To activate the module, you

need an ELO Barcode serial number.

Log on to the ELO Java Client as administrator.

Please note

Barcode serial numbers are unique to each workstation and may not be used multiple

times.

Enter the barcode serial number in the Technical presets area of the configuration.

For more information, refer to the Enable barcode recognition chapter.

Configure metadata form for barcode recognition 

Create a metadata form for barcode recognition in the ELO Administration Console under Metadata

forms and fields.

You will find the settings for barcode recognition in the Barcode info part of the metadata form.

Check the Enable barcode recognition box.

The Barcode info field is completed automatically. With the default settings, the entire page

is searched for barcodes (R(0,0,1000,1000)) and all pages of a document (P(0)).

Barcodes are read via instructions. Instructions for targeted processing of barcode

information are defined in the Barcode info input field.

Set your preferences under the options Scan area, Check, Scan and file, and Assign metadata.

Your settings are automatically entered as instructions into the Barcode info input field.

Please note

Only a complete barcode instruction in the metadata form guarantees that barcode

information is read. Each barcode requires one R instruction, one T instruction, and

one or more S instructions.

For more information, refer to the chapter Configuration.

Start barcode recognition 

In the ELO Java Client, you can start barcode recognition in the Intray work area.

Select the document with the barcode information in the Intray.

On the ribbon, click File > Edit > Barcode recognition.

The barcode is read and the metadata is created. The barcode information is now located in the

assigned fields. To view the metadata, click File > Metadata on the ribbon.

Outlook 

In the second step, you can automatically file the documents if the metadata form has valid index

information.

On the ribbon, click File > Filing > Automatic filing.

Information

If the metadata form does not have a filing definition, you must select the filing location

manually. Use the function File to ELO (available in: Ribbon > File).

Basics 

Barcodes are used to encode characters and numerals. This enables you to uniquely assign

information that the ELO Barcode module can read quickly and reliably, and then use this

information to index documents.

One important aspect in filing documents electronically is assigning them the correct metadata so

that you can access the document without any problems at a later point in time. Errors in manual

entry, such as entering incorrect customer or invoice numbers, result in unsuccessful searches. ELO

Barcode simplifies and speeds up metadata entry and indexing processes.

Overview of functions 

The main functions of ELO Barcode include:

Automatic barcode recognition for scanned documents

Converting barcodes into search terms (indexing)

The barcode is read during filing from the Intray to ELO. The following options are available:

Defining a rectangular area in which the barcode is located (barcode area)

Searching an entire document

You can assign parts of the barcodes to different fields in the metadata form. You can also define

the characters of the barcode as a verification feature. During barcode conversion, ELO turns this

barcode content into searchable attributes (metadata).

Factors that affect barcode recognition 

Quality 

Scanners are grid-oriented devices that usually work with 200 to 400 dpi (dots per inch). If a grid-

oriented device scans a symbol without a grid, valuable information is lost. There are many other

factors resulting in additional loss of data or even in data distortion. Poor recognition results can

only be avoided if all the factors are considered to the fullest extent. The following factors must be

taken into account to guarantee reliable barcode recognition:

Barcode type

Resolution (dpi)

Barcode width

Vertical barcode height

Barcode symbol alignment

Quiet zones

Scanner settings

Document quality

Barcode label quality

Barcode recognition characteristics 

Barcode recognition is primarily used to assign documents metadata. You can automate this

process to prevent any errors from occurring. System performance and data integrity depend on

the reliability of the device for barcode recognition as well as on the image quality. ELO Barcode

uses the best possible scanning algorithms. However, this alone does not automatically ensure a

high rate of recognition. The preceding list therefore explains the individual factors that will help

you achieve reliable barcode recognition.

Information

Distorted or damaged barcodes can cause errors in barcode recognition.

Barcode type 

The structure and design of a barcode symbol frequently lead to poor readability. Barcode type 

Code 39 seems to have the highest tolerance with a marginal corruption of the input data. This is

why we recommend using Code 39.

Resolution in dots per inch (DPI) 

Barcodes can be scanned reliably at a resolution of 200, 300, and 400 dpi. Lower dpi values require

larger barcode symbols to achieve reliable recognition. For good results, we recommend you select

the character density of the barcode symbols according to the values listed below.

Recommended barcode width 

The width of the barcode is one of the most important factors for reliable barcode recognition. The

wider the barcode is, the better the symbol resolution and recognition.

There is no formula to determine the best width for a barcode symbol. The general rule is not to

exceed the following values:

6 characters per inch (one inch = 2.54 cm) at a resolution of 300 dpi

4 characters per inch (one inch = 2.54 cm) at a resolution of 200 dpi

These values include all the characters of a barcode symbol, such as synchronizing, data, start, and

stop characters as well as the optional check digit.

Vertical barcode height 

Theoretically, ELO Barcode is capable of recognizing a barcode that is only one scan line high.

However, in reality the barcode symbols have different alignments, i.e., the barcode does not run

parallel to the vertical and horizontal margins of a document. This is caused, for example, when

barcode labels are applied manually, when the printer is not aligned correctly, or when the scanner

is not aligned properly. Under normal circumstances, ELO Barcode reads the barcode from left to

right.

• 

• 

96 Client administration



The highest degree of reliability is achieved when the barcode is placed such that one horizontal

scan line comprises the entire barcode symbol from start to stop character. To recognize the left

and right margins of the symbol in a single line, the barcode's vertical size needs to be large

enough to allow for a maximum angle ("angular position").

Barcode symbol alignment 

If a barcode is placed on the document at an angle, this could cause a single scan line to miss

information (from start to stop character) of a barcode. ELO Barcode offers an alignment correction

option for reading barcode symbols placed at an angle. The alignment correction function helps

recover information from barcodes place at an angle. However, using the correction feature has a

definite impact on scanning speed. It can also cause scan errors. This is why we recommend only

using the function as a backup and not in normal operation.

Quiet zones 

Most barcode standards require a "quiet zone" to the left and right of the barcode symbol. In a

bitmap image, this quiet zone should be entirely white. Noise ("dirty" pixels in the image) or text

"shimmering through" and label edges often result in corrupted quiet zones. This can cause errors

in barcode recognition.

A quiet zone at the top or bottom of a barcode symbol must have a height of greater than three

pixels. The quiet zones to the left and right of the barcode symbol must be a minimum of eight

pixels wide.

Scanner settings 

Many scanners feature a contrast setting option. This threshold-value setting determines the shade

of gray when a pixel is no longer interpreted as white but as gray or black. This option allows you

to adjust the scanner to the individual properties of the respective documents.

Changing the threshold value could cause the black areas in the barcode symbols to appear wider

or narrower than they really are. This process is also called "distortion". The barcode symbols may

become illegible even if they look perfectly acceptable to the human eye.

Barcode quality 

Keep the following in mind when placing barcode labels:

The width of the labels should allow for quite zones around the barcode.

The barcode resolution and display should be sufficiently dimensioned.

The printing resolution should be 300 dpi or higher.

Labels printed with matrix printers are not permitted.

Label printers with ink ribbons are problematic.

The glue must be of high enough quality to prevent the labels from rolling up or peeling off.

The label paper must be thick enough to avoid "shimmering through" of text that is covered

by the label.

Configuration 

The ELO Barcode interface works on two levels. The first level is contained entirely within ELO and

is responsible for the recognition of the barcodes and the distribution of the recognized text to the

fields of the metadata form. This is usually sufficient for most applications.

If additional processing steps are required, a program can be run via the Microsoft VB-Scripting

Host interface, where these steps can be performed.

Configure metadata form 

To process barcode documents with the ELO Java Client, you have to define a metadata form for

capturing barcode information in the ELO Administration Console.

Go to Metadata forms and fields in the ELO Administration Console.

Select the metadata form for barcode documents from the list.

In our example, this is the Barcode metadata form.

Optional: Create a new metadata form for barcode documents.

Barcode info input field 

Brief overview 

Check the Enable barcode recognition box.

The Barcode info field is completed automatically. With the default settings, the entire page

is searched for barcodes (R(0,0,1000,1000)) and all pages of a document (P(0)).

Barcodes are read via instructions. Instructions for targeted processing of barcode

information are defined in the Barcode info input field.

Set your preferences under the options Scan area, Check, Scan and file, and Assign metadata.

Your settings are automatically entered as instructions into the Barcode info input field. 

Please note

Only a complete barcode instruction in the metadata form guarantees that barcode

information is read. Each barcode requires one R instruction, one T instruction, and

one or more S instructions.

Each entry group – referred to as R group in the following – is preceded by an R instruction.

This instruction determines the area scanned for barcodes. This instruction may be followed

by an L instruction, which can check minimum and maximum input lengths. This is followed

by a T instruction that determines the barcode type and how barcode-free pages are handled.

V instructions can then check certain barcode positions for fixed characters that you have

defined previously. A sequence of S instructions determines how the barcode is broken down

1. 

2. 

101 Client administration



and assigned to the fields in the metadata form. The P instruction defines which page of a

document is scanned for barcodes. Another R group can follow after this.

Information

Group names must not be used multiple times in the metadata form.

The instructions are explained in detail in the following.

R instruction 

With the R instruction, you define the area on a page where the barcode information is located.

Determine which area of the page is scanned for barcodes.

Syntax: R(<left>,<top>,<width>,<height)

The four coordinates of the R instruction define the checked area in per-thousandths of the total

scan area. An entry of form R(100,200,300,400) defines the area from the left = 2.1 cm, top = 6 cm,

width = 6.3 cm and height = 12 cm on an A4 page (21*30 cm). Only this zone is scanned for

barcodes. If you want to check the entire input area, you can select the entire area by entering 

R(0,0,1000,1000).

Information

If you need multiple barcode areas on a page, add additional new R parameters to the 

Barcode info field.

L instruction 

Use the L instruction to check the minimum and maximum length of a barcode.

Syntax: L(<minimum>, <maximum)

Barcodes usually have a fixed length (e.g., a 6-digit document number) per document. When you

limit the allowed area (such as L(6,6)) here, you can avoid incorrect recognition caused by

incomplete or other barcodes.

T instruction 

The T instruction defines the barcode type.

Syntax: T(<type)

Use the T instruction to define which barcode types you want the program to recognize. The value

is binary and entered as a hexadecimal value. The following options are available:

Codabar 1 (0x1)

Code 128 2 (0x2)

102 Client administration



Code 39 4 (0x4)

I 2 of 5 8 (0x8)

EAN 13 16 (0x10)

EAN 8 32 (0x20)

UPC A 64 (0x40)

UPC E 128 (0x80)

Data Matrix 2048

QR code 512

PDF 417 536870912

GS1 Databar 1073741824

You can create any combination by adding the corresponding values (e.g., for Code 128 and Code

39 = 2 + 4 = 6).

Pages with no barcode: There are also pseudo-types with values 4096 and 8192 (0x1000 and

0x2000). Type 4096 (0x1000) defines what to do with pages without barcode. If this type is not set,

the page is ignored by the barcode manager. If this type is set, a barcode-free page is appended to

the previous page that has a recognized barcode (for multi-page documents).

Consecutive pages: Type 8192 (0x2000) decides what happens with consecutive pages that have

identical barcodes. With this type, such pages are summarized automatically. If this type is not

used, all pages remain independent documents. These pseudo-types are only recognized in the first

R group and are then valid for all the forms used in a barcode process. You cannot use types 4096

and 8192 at the same time. Either use type 4096 (collating pages without barcodes), type 8192

(collating pages with identical barcodes), or none at all.

Add blank pages 4096 (0x1000)

Add identical pages 8192 (0x2000)

Create checksum 16384 (0x4000)

Scan direction: Last, a T instruction defines the scan direction of the barcode. If you do not use any

special settings, the default setting is left to right. In addition, you can use any combination of the

four options:

Left to right 65536 (0x10000)

Right to left 131072 (0x20000)

Bottom to top 262144 (0x40000)

Top to bottom 524288 (0x80000)

V instruction 

You can use certain characters for validating barcodes with the V instruction.

Syntax: V(<pos>='<character>') 

103 Client administration



You can check certain barcode positions for fixed characters using the V instruction. If you scan

delivery notes, and your barcode consists of a delivery note ID ("DE" in the first two positions) and

a delivery note number, you can avoid incorrect scans using the V(1='L') V(2='F') control. Within

an R group, you can define as many V instructions as required. Note that apostrophes (') must be

placed in front of and behind the check character.

S instruction 

The S instruction assigns barcode information to a field in the metadata form. The group name of

the field is used for the assignment. Multiple S instructions can be used.

Syntax:

S(<group name field>=<Startpos>,<number)

The barcode is assigned to the fields using one or multiple S instructions. The S instruction defines

which part of the barcode is transferred to which field (<group name of the field) via <startpos>

and <number>. The group name of the field provides you with every field that has been assigned a

group name in the current metadata form definition. 

Information

Group names specified in the metadata form must be unique. Group names must not be

used multiple times in the barcode metadata form.

If you fill a metadata form with multiple S instructions, these entries are saved without a separator

directly one after another. If you have entered an ISO date (YYYYMMDD) in the barcode and want to

transfer it to ELO, you must first change it to ELO format (DD.MM.YYYY or short DDMMYYYY). You

can enter S(DLDATE=7,2) S(DLDATE=5,2) S(DLDATE=1,4). This is assuming that the date field is

assigned to the first 8 characters of the barcode and that it will be entered into the DLDATE field.

P instruction 

The P instruction defines which page of a document is scanned for barcodes.

Syntax: P (<number of pages)

Information

To scan all pages of a document for barcodes, enter P (0) as the P instruction.

Example 

R(0,0,1000,1000)T(1610685183)S(BAR1=1,50)S(BAR2=1,18)P(0)

For the above example, the following information is evaluated and assigned:

• 

104 Client administration



The R instruction defines the zone on a page where the barcodes are located. The entire page

is marked.

The HEX value of the T instruction is 1610685183. This value corresponds to the binary value

1100000000000010001101011111111. This is how the barcode types are defined that should

be evaluated in the document.

The two S instructions determine that two barcodes are applied to the fields with the

corresponding group name.

The P instruction defines that all pages of the document are scanned for barcodes.

Scan area 

Page only 

Determine what page of a document should be scanned for a barcode. 

To search all pages, enter the value 0. A P instruction based on your entry is automatically created

in the Barcode info field.

Scan direction 

You can determine the scan direction of a barcode during recognition.

The default is Left to right. This means if you do not use any special settings, barcode recognition

always scans from left to right. 

Check 

Minimum/maximum length 

To filter out unknown barcodes, you can define a minimum and maximum length. 

Barcodes usually have a fixed length (e.g., a 6-digit document number) per document. If you limit

the allowed area here, you can prevent detection of unwanted or incomplete barcodes.

information. 

Information

You will find more information on the different barcodes in the Barcode types chapter.

Select all barcode types used in this way. You can enable all types with the Select all option.

Information

If you restrict the possible barcode types to a small number, this increases the processing

speed and reduces the error rate when recognizing the barcodes.

Editing settings 

Checksum: Use this option to determine whether the checksum should be evaluated for a barcode.

When you deactivate the option, the checksum of the barcode is ignored. The checksum is returned

when you enable this option. This option only works with barcodes that have a "built in" checksum,

such as Code 128.

Narrow quiet zone: Barcodes need free space around the barcode so it can be recognized. When

you enable this option, a border of 10 pixels is entered, otherwise the quiet zone is 10% of the

image resolution. 

106 Client administration



Scan and file 

Filing settings 

Ignore non-compliant barcodes: Exclude barcodes of the same type from the check. Documents

with multiple pages are read even more precisely to guarantee correct joining in ELO. 

You need to activate this option to exclude third-party barcodes.

Add page without barcode to the previous page: Determine what will happen with barcode-free

pages within a document with barcode information.

This option adds a barcode-free page to the last page with a recognized barcode. If this option is

disabled, ELO Barcode will ignore pages without a barcode.

Join pages with identical barcodes: Determine what happens to consecutive pages with identical

barcodes. If this option is enabled, pages with identical barcodes are joined automatically. If this

option is disabled, all the pages remain as separate documents.

Image enhancements 

There are several options available to improve the quality of the scanned barcode. 

Despeckle: Removes scan noise. 

Median: Removes image noise in high-resolution scans. 

Oversampling: Improves the image quality in low-resolution scans. 

Noise reduction 

Noise reduction removes characters that are probably not part of the barcode. If the value is too

large, parts of the barcode may be removed. A typical value is 10.

Barcode types 

This chapter contains detailed explanations on some of the supported barcode types. We do not

guarantee that this information is complete.

EAN 13/EAN 8 

EAN is the abbreviation for: European Article Numbering.

Basic structure of an EAN barcode 

Two-digit country code + five-digit manufacturer + five-digit product no. + 1 check digit (for

EAN13).

The EAN barcode can only describe the numbers 0-9. Each character has 11 times the module

width. This barcode type basically provides ten different, defined sizes. EAN is used, for instance, in

supermarkets because their data collection is extremely labor-intensive due to the large number of

articles per customer.

The European Article Number is printed on the packaging material of the product encoded as

barcode. Normally, an article number consists of 13 digits. However, an additional eight-digit short

symbol was created for smaller articles (EAN 8).

The first two digits of an EAN 13 code identify the country of origin (country code). Numbers 40-43

stand for Germany. The next five digits identify the product's manufacturer. The next five digits

comprise the individual article number and classify the manufacturer’s product. This number is

assigned directly by the manufacturer. The final digit is the check digit and is determined by

calculating. EANs are assigned by GS1 Germany GmbH (www.gs1-germany.de).

Code 39 

This barcode is an alphanumeric code whose character set comprises the digits 0 to 9, 26 upper-

case letters (A-Z), a space character as well as several special characters ($ – + / . % ,). In the

following example, a barcode created with Code 39, contains the word "CODE 39:

111 Client administration



Every character consists of nine elements (five lines and four gaps). Of these nine elements, three

are wide and six are narrow. This feature allows for a self-test of Code 39. There is a gap between

the individual characters for separation purposes. The advantage of this code is the large character

set. Character combinations allow additional character representations. The drawbacks are the low

information density (8 mm) and the low error tolerance.

Interleaved 2 of 5 (Code 25 Interleaved) 

This code is a variation of the original Code 25 which also has a character set of only digits 0 to 9.

The objective is to save space by representing coded digits in pairs. Code 25 Interleaved has no

integrated check digit. Each digit is represented by five symbols (two wide and three narrow ones).

The first character consists of lines, the second of gaps, the third of lines, then the fourth of gaps,

etc.

112 Client administration



Code 25 Interleaved offers, similarly to Code 39, advantages such as self-testing as well as high

information density and the therefore resulting low storage requirement. The low tolerance and

representation of the usable symbols in pairs could be considered as a drawback. The start and

stop characters contain only two symbols, which may lead to incorrect or partial recognition

because only an even number of characters can be represented.

If an uneven number of characters is required, you have to place a zero in front of the code (123

becomes 0123) or add a check digit.

UPC A 

UPC (Universal Product Code) A is the 12-digit standard version of the UPC code. It is similar to the

EAN code and is also referred to as UPC 12. The UPC is a numeric code that can display the digits

0-9. Each symbol contains two bars and two gaps.

The first digit of the UPC A shows the contents of the code:

0: Normal, standard UPC code

1: Reserved (possibly for later use)

2: Products charged by weight. The barcode is created in the store to price a product.

3: National Drug Code (NDC) and National Health Related Items Code (HRI)

4: UPC code that can be used without formatting restrictions.

5: Coupon

6: Normal, standard UPC code

7: Normal, standard UPC Codex

8: Reserved for later use

9: Reserved for later use

113 Client administration



The second to sixth digits of the UPC identify the manufacturer of the product (UPC ID number).

This number is assigned by GS1 US Inc. (www.gs1us.org). Digits seven to eleven of the UPC

comprise the individual part number and classify the manufacturer’s product. The last digit (twelve)

is the check digit which is determined by calculation.

UPC E 

The UPC E is a numeric code that can display the digits 0-9. A UPC E has eight digits. The first digit

is the system identifier and is always set to "0". The eight digit is the check digit.

The coded digits are written in plain text below the code.

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to set up scan functionality with the ELO Java Client in Linux.

The SANE interface enables you to scan documents in the ELO Java Client when using Linux. See

the SANE project page for additional information on SANE.

Information

macOS

The SANE interface is no longer supported in macOS. You can use JSON scan instead. To scan

with JSON scan, change the scan method in the configuration. You do not need to install

anything else. You will find more information on how to configure the scan method in this

documentation under Configuration > Technical presets > General.

Installation and configuration 

Installation of SANE backends 

The basic requirement to scan in macOS and Linux is the installation of the SANE backends

package. The installation can be verified by entering scanimage –L in the command line. You should

then see a list of the available scanners.

Linux 

In Linux, SANE backends can be installed using the appropriate package manager. Consult the

documentation for your Linux distribution for more information on this point.

Configuration in the ELO Java Client 

In the configuration dialog box, SANE must be selected as the scan method in the Technical presets

> General area.

Notes 

Some options in the scan profiles may not work with certain scanner models.

Scanning after preview is not available with SANE.

Only the connected scanners are shown under Select scanner instead of all installed

scanners.

ELO Macros (HTTP)

Installation 

This documentation describes how to install and set up the ELO Macros using the ELO Java Client

HTTP Automation Interface.

The ELO Macros integrate several functions of the ELO Java Client into external programs. The

following external programs are supported:

Microsoft Windows Explorer

Microsoft Word

Microsoft Excel

Microsoft PowerPoint

Microsoft Outlook

Microsoft Internet Explorer

Mozilla Firefox

Google Chrome

Installation can only be performed by users with administrator rights.

Enable HTTP Automation Interface 

To use the ELO Macros, the HTTP Automation Interface must be enabled.

Please note The following settings must be made for all users using the ELO

Macros.

You will find the setting in the ELO Java Client configuration under Technical presets > General.

You also have to assign a free server port that the HTTP Automation Interface can use to

communicate the with the ELO Macros.

The server port 0 is set by default. As a result, ELO automatically identifies and assigns a free port.

Call functions 

The location of the functions varies depending on the operating system.

Microsoft Windows 

In Microsoft Windows, you will find the functions on the extra ELO tab in Microsoft Office programs.

macOS 

In macOS, you will find the functions on the menu bar at the top edge of the screen. After the ELO

Macros are installed, a scroll icon appears in the menu bar. The scroll icon opens a drop-down menu

containing the ELO Macros functions.

IBM Notes 

In IBM Notes, you will find the functions in the File to ELO area.

Overview of functions 

The ELO Macros provide the following functions.

Information

Depending on the operating system, the names and icons for the functions may differ.

ELO Transfer 

The ELO Transfer function files documents to ELO. You can set the filing location for the document in

the File new document dialog box. Click New folder to create a new folder for the document.

Depending on the configuration, you must enter metadata for the document.

E-mails that contain attachments with special characters in the name can be filed as separate

documents.

123 Client administration



Automatically file to ELO 

The Automatically file to ELO function is intended for e-mails. This function allows you to

automatically file documents to ELO. To file e-mails automatically, you have to set the Filing target

for sent e-mails and Filing target for received e-mails paths in the ELO Macros configuration.

Transfer to ELO Intray 

The Transfer to ELO Intray button files documents to the ELO Intray. In the ELO Intray, you can edit

the metadata and file the documents to the ELO repository.

124 Client administration



ELO search 

The ELO search function opens the Search work area in the ELO Java Client. The ELO Macros

automatically transfer available metadata to the ELO search field. Clicking Start search begins the

search.

Configuration 

The Configuration function is where you configure the ELO Macros (see also chapter Configuration).

125 Client administration



Dynamic folders

What are dynamic folders? 

Dynamic folders are folders in ELO whose contents are generated dynamically. In principle, these

show the results of a search. This search is performed using a specific SQL query. You can use

different search criteria (e.g. specific metadata). Every time something changes in ELO that is

relevant to the query, the contents of the dynamic folder change as well.

Please note

If you want to create dynamic folders, always test them first in a small test repository. An

incorrectly worded command can generate hits in the range of (total number of documents)

* (total number of fields for all documents). A test repository may result in several thousand

hits, while the hits in a productive repository could quickly reach into the millions.

Please note

If you want to use a dynamic folder in a live repository, you should give some thought to

performance. If the folder will be accessed on a regular basis, you need to make sure that

access does not trigger any full table scans. To ensure this, you should analyze the SQL

statement (e.g. in SQL Server Management Studio).

Dynamic folders in the ELO Java Client 

The ELO Java Client provides the option to save a search query as a dynamic folder.

You will find this function under Search > Result > Dynamic folder. This documentation does not go

into detail on the function. You will find more information in the ELO Java Client documentation.

https://docs.elo.com/user/elo-java-client/en-us/elo-java-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folder


Dynamic folders in the ELO Web Client 

The ELO Web Client also provides the option to save a search request as a dynamic folder.

You will find this function under Search > Result > Dynamic folder. This documentation does not go

into detail on the function. You will find more information in the ELO Web Client documentation.

Please note

Queries may vary depending on the database system. So you may have to make

adjustments to the change examples shown here.

127 Client administration

https://docs.elo.com/user/elo-web-client/en-us/elo-web-client/manual/search-tab.html#dynamic-folder


Create dynamic folders 

A dynamic folder is created by making a specific entry to a folder's extra text tab. This text must

be placed at the very beginning of the field and no other text can be entered there. To prevent the

folder definition from being changed by mistake, only administrators should have write access to

the folder. Other users can be given read access to it. This restriction also helps you avoid child

entries being manually stored in the folder, since they would not be displayed.

!+[command] 

The !+ command is replaced at runtime with the SQL statement SELECT * FROM for the database

table dbo.objects. You can define the WHERE part of the query following the !+ command.

128 Client administration



Make sure you restrict your WHERE clause to the desired object types (assuming that they are not

defined by the other search restrictions anyway). You should also exclude deleted entries, which are

all entries with an objstatus not equal to 0.

Query multiple tables 

You can add other tables besides the objects table to the query. To do so, enter the other tables

following a comma.

Example 1 

In this example, the query is restricted to the EMail metadata form (here: objmask = 2). The query

also only searches for documents that have a specific name (here: Sorglos) in the From field (group

name: ELOOUTL1).

Example 2 

The following example runs a query that sorts the entries by two different fields. This means the 

objkeys table must be read twice.

!+ , objkeys WHERE objid = parentid

AND objmask = 2

AND (okeyname LIKE 'ELOOUTL1' AND okeydata LIKE '%sorglos')

129 Client administration



An explanation of the individual lines of code:

The table objkeys is entered twice under the names ok1 and ok2. Remember to insert the leading

comma, otherwise you will get a syntax error at the SQL level and the target folder will remain

empty.

The objects base database table is linked to the two tables with the unique key objid.

We want to read two specific fields, rather than any two fields (the internal field numbers *0 *and 1

correspond to the first and second fields in the form).

You only want to find documents with form type 5 that contain the value p1 in the first field.

The documents are then sorted by the second field. All identical entries are sorted by the first field.

Please note

The example searches for the contents of any field that start with p1, i. e. that a result is

also generated if p1 occurs in a hidden field. However, the user will not see the

corresponding field. In a production system, you should give the field a specific name.

Please note

The objid=parentid part of the query is required in any case. This connects the basic data

table with the fields table. If you leave it out, you will get a long list of hits with entries that

are wrong.

!?[command] 

A registered function must follow the !? command. The registered function must return a collection

of IDs or GUIDs that correspond to a repository entry. You can learn what a registered function is

and how to create them in the documentation Adding functionality with registered functions.

Example of a dynamic folder:

The script file could look like this:

!+ , objkeys ok1, objkeys ok2 WHERE

objid=ok1.parentid AND objid=ok2.parentid AND

ok1.okeyno=0 AND ok2.okeyno=1 AND

objtype=254 AND objmask=5 AND

ok1.okeydata LIKE 'p1%'

ORDER BY ok2.okeydata, ok1.okeydata

https://docs.elo.com/dev/programming/en-us/elo-indexserver-programming-guide/added-functionality-with-registered-functions/


!=[command] 

You can pass a saved search to the != command. However, the folder should be created

automatically instead of manually. In the ELO Java Client, you can create a dynamic folder

following a search via Ribbon > Search > Result > Dynamic folder.

To create a dynamic folder in your own IX application, you need to perform a search first. You will

find the corresponding text in the field FindResult.dynamicFolder, which is provided through the IX

interface.

For example:

Obsolete commands 

The commands !! and *!** are obsolete and are no longer supported in current ELO versions.

function RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere(ec, args) {

  log.info("RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere(")

  var sord = args[0]

  log.info("sord=" + sord)

  var folderId = parseInt(args[1])

  log.info("folderId=" + folderId)

  var db = new Packages.de.elo.ix.jscript.DBConnection()

  var ret = db.query(

    "select objectid from relation where parentid=? order by objectid desc",

    folderId

  )

  log.info(")RF_getSordIdsForDynamicWhere" + ret)

  return ret

}

FindResult fr = ixConnection.ix().findFirstSords(…);

ixConnection.ix().findClose(fr.getSearchId());

Sord sord = ixConnection.ix().checkoutSord(…);

sord.setDesc(fr.getDynamicFolder());

ixConnection.ix().checkinSord(sord, …);

Additional notes 

Performance 

A search is initiated every time a dynamic folder is opened. With small databases (<50,000

entries), you do not need to give any consideration to performance, as the SQL server optimizes all

problems away here.

As soon as the database becomes larger, though, a badly formed search query will instantly

generate a massive load on the database. This will result in lowered performance for all clients.

You need to take the following into account:

Is an appropriate index available for the selection criterion? If not, can one be created? If the

answer to both of these questions is no, you should probably avoid using dynamic folders. A full

table scan can take over a half an hour on a large database.

Does the SQL server use an index at all? Sometimes, the optimizer has a very different idea of how

to process the query than the administrator. If the SQL server selects an unfavorable index, it may

lead to long response times.

Does the list of search results stay within reasonable limits? If you create a statement that collects

all documents filed within a month, this might work on a test system. However, if you want to view

50,000 documents in a single folder on a production system, this will lead to poor results.

Available columns 

The following columns are available in the base data:

Column name Contents

objtype Entry type, top-level folder=1, 2nd level=2… folders=253, document=254

objshort Short name

objidate Filing date in numeric format (number of minutes since Dec. 31, 1899)

objxdate Document date in numeric format

objkind Color

objmask Document type

objuser Document creator

objstatus 0: not deleted, all other values indicate deleted entries

objdeldate Expiration date in numeric format

The objkeys table contains the following entries:

Column

name
Contents

parentid Internal unique ELO entry number, connected to objid in the objects base table.

132 Client administration



Column

name
Contents

okeyno
Number of the field, starting with 0. There are a number of hidden fields starting

with index field 50.

okeyname
Group name of the field. If you want to search independent of document type, use

the group name instead of the field number for selection.

okeydata Content of the field

okeyudata Content of the field in uppercase (Oracle databases only)

Specific to Oracle SQL 

There are a number of aspects specific to Oracle SQL databases that you will need to take into

account. Otherwise, you will get incomplete search results or syntax errors.

Oracle SQL distinguishes between upper and lowercase letters. If you search for "ELO" and the

database contains "Elo", Oracle will not find the entry. The okeyudata field enables you to search in

metadata fields.

The repository name must be placed before the table names. Both parts are separated with a

period.

Example 

In Oracle SQL databases, you need to enter okeydata ok1 as repository1.okeydata ok1 in the query.

133 Client administration



Usage examples 

Please note

Queries may vary depending on the database system. So you may have to make

adjustments to the following examples.

Show documents added to the repository in the last 30 days 

Enter the following SQL query to the extra text field of the folder that you want to configure as a

dynamic folder.

The individual components of the query:

objtype>=254: Restricts the query to documents

objstatus=0: Restricts the query to documents that are not deleted

DATEADD(mi, objidate, '18991230'): Searches for the filing date (objidate) in minutes (mi)

since the reference date (December 30, 1899).

Information

The ISO date was selected here to avoid possible conversion problems. In English-language

installations, MM/DD/YYYY usually works as well.

>=: The operators restrict the search to documents with a filing date later than or equal to

the current date minus 30 days.

DATEADD(day, -30, SYSUTCDATETIME()): Here the system date is read out in UTC format

(SYSUTCDATETIME()) in days (day). 30 days are then subtracted from that.

Information

The SYSUTCDATETIME function was not available until SQL Server 2005. If you are using an

earlier version of the software, use the function GETDATE().

Other usage examples 

Task Entry to Extra text tab

All documents that use the Basic Entry metadata

form. The list of results is sorted in descending order

(DESC) by the document date (objxdate).

!+ WHERE objmask=0 AND objtype>=254 AND

objstatus=0 ORDER BY objxdate DESC

!+ WHERE objtype>=254 AND objstatus=0 AND DATEADD(mi, objidate, '18991230') >= DATEADD(day, -30, SYSUTCDATE

elodms links

Introduction 

elodms links are URLs that take you straight to a destination in the ELO Java Client. This

documentation describes the various formats available for these links and how to use them.

elodms links are available in the ELO Java Client starting with version 9.01. They can be used as

standard URLs in scripts and websites, or as part of custom ECD files (ELO links). When the ELO

Java Client is installed, links starting with elodms:// are automatically associated with 

EloActivateJC.exe.

Information

elodms links do not work in Linux or Mac macOS versions of the program.

elodms links can be used to open the following destinations:

GUID of an entry in ELO

Page of a document with a specific annotation in ELO

Specific page of a document in ELO

Specific workflow and/or workflow node in ELO

An ELO Java Client import package (a separate ELO automatic script installation

documentation is available for this)

The elodms links described in the following sections are constructed as URLs that are opened from

an HTML document. If you wish to use an elodms link in an ECD file, first create a text file in UTF-8

format with the following contents:

Save the file with the extension *.ECD.

Use 

elodms GUID links 

This section describes how to create elodms links to jump to an entry in the current repository. The

basic syntax is as follows:

elodms://<ELO GUID>

You can find an entry's GUID on the Options tab of the metadata form.

Enter the GUID enclosed in parentheses, such as:

elodms://(C1128681-C328-DE51-C99E-FA463C6C6911)

An entry's GUID can be called in the internal scripting with the following:

elodms links with annotation number 

An elodms:// GUID link can be constructed with an instruction to jump to the page number of a

specific annotation. The basic syntax is as follows:

elodms://<ELO GUID>@A<annotation ID>

var item = … // arbitrary code to select an ArchiveElement

var sord = item.sord;

var guid = sord.guid;

…

137 Client administration



The easiest way to get this information is to right-click an annotation and select Remember

position from the context menu. This copies the name of the document and the annotation's

position to the system clipboard. Delete the part of the string before elodms:// to get the required

link.

elodms links with page number 

elodms:// GUID links can also be instructed to jump to a document page. The basic syntax is as

follows:

elodms://<ELO GUID>@P<Page number>

In this case, the numbering starts at 1. If an invalid page number is specified, the link automatically

goes to the first page of the document.

elodms object ID links 

The ELO object ID can also be used instead of the GUID:

elodms://<ELO object ID>

If the object ID is used, it is not possible to set anchors for annotations and page numbers.

elodms workflow links 

elodms links with wf at the start jump automatically to a specific workflow in the client. The basic

syntax is as follows:

elodms://wf/<workflow ID (int)>/<node ID (int)>

138 Client administration



If the node ID is 0 or missing, the link attempts to go to the first available (unprocessed) node in

the workflow.

The ELO Java Client does not display the workflow ID or node ID using built-in functions. These

values can be retrieved using either the ELO Java Client script GotoId or by using the following the

following (sample) code:

Script installer URLs 

Script installer URLs are used to install/import scripts as used on install.myelo.net. The basic

syntax is as follows:

elodms://im/<URL>

The URL is encoded in Base64.

You require administrator rights for the call. The call triggers a query in the client.

var item = … // random code to select a TaskElement

var workflow = item.task.wfNode;

var workflowId = workflow.flowId;

var workflowNodeId = workflow.nodeId;

...

Platforms

Basics 

This documentation provides an overview of the operating systems and other platforms supported

by the ELO Java Client. The functional limitations and differences between the platforms are also

mentioned, as are the ELO add-on modules required for some functions.

Installation and rights 

Microsoft Windows 

Installing the client via MSI package requires, administrator rights to the computer. In later

operation, only normal user rights are required.

System requirements 

Required 

You will find a list of the system requirements for the ELO Java Client in the ELO system

requirements documentation.

Recommended 

2 GB of RAM

Dual core processor

OpenJDK uses its own memory management system. The ELO Java Client is configured to allow it

to use up to 1 GB of RAM. This is a fixed upper limit which can be reached temporarily when

working with large image files. During normal operation, usually only 200-300 MB of RAM will be in

use.

To display documents in the client preview, different classes are available. These can be configured

for various file formats. Some of these preview classes are permanently implemented in the client,

while others use external programs, such as a browser or an Office application, for embedded

display.

Many other file formats can be displayed via the browser preview (or Microsoft Internet Explorer

preview) if a corresponding plug-in is installed in the browser.

File formats

Introduction 

This documentation gives an overview of the file formats supported by the viewer in the ELO

clients. It also explains functional limitations and differences between the ELO clients, as well as

requirements and additional software.

The following chapters explains the procedure in the ELO Java Client and ELO Web Client.

146 Client administration



ELO Java Client 

The ELO Java Client assigns file formats to different previews in order to show these file formats in

the viewer.

The ELO Java Client viewer supports the following formats:

Browser preview: 

HTML, HTM, MHT

Internet Explorer ActiveX Plug-ins (only Windows, e. g. PDF with Acrobat Reader)

MSG/EML with HTML display

Text preview 

JS, TXT, LOG, text formats

EML e-mail preview, MSG e-mail preview 

MSG/EML without HTML display

OpenOffice preview (up to ELO 11, if Libre/Open Office is installed) 

Office formats depending on the installed Office Suite components

MS Office preview (Windows, with Microsoft Office version 2007 and higher, and with the

components matching the formats) 

DOC, DOCX, DOCM, DOT, DOTX, XLS, XLSM, XLSX, XLT, XLTX, PPT, PPTX, POT, POTX,

VSD, VST, VSS, ODT, ODS, ODP, RTF

Microsoft Office web preview (with ELOimo) 

Office formats, PDF depending on the installed ELOimo components

Windows Media Player preview (Windows) 

Various A/V formats

Media player preview 

MP3, MP4, WAV

Information on configuring the viewer in the ELO Java Client 

The image preview also supports less well-known formats; Java ImageIO plug-ins can be installed

as necessary.

The browser preview supports additional formats if corresponding plug-ins have been installed in

Internet Explorer.

When Open Office has been installed and integrated, the Open Office preview supports the majority

of Office formats.

147 Client administration



The ActiveX plug-in preview supports the ELO plug-ins also used in the ELO Windows Client – these

just have to be configured.

The Apple OSX preview represents an alternative to the Microsoft Internet Explorer-based browser

preview; no detailed list of supported formats is available.

Selecting Show preview document forces the system to display a preview document instead of the

document. The configuration appropriate for the preview document then applies (PDF, TIFF).

148 Client administration



ELO Web Client 

The ELO Web Client assigns file formats to different previews in order to show these file formats in

the viewer.

The ELO Web Client viewer supports the following formats:

BMP

EML

GIF

ICO (web preview only)

JPG

MSG

PDF

PNG

TIFF

TXT (unformatted text formats)

The individual file formats can be assigned to different previews in the configuration.

Image preview: The graphic formats are shown via the ELO Indexserver.

Web preview: With the web preview, the file to be shown is embedded in an IFRAME element. The

display options of the current browser are used.

Microsoft Office documents: Microsoft Office documents can be viewed using Microsoft Web Apps or

the ELO Interface for Microsoft Office Online Server (ELOimo), provided that a corresponding

Microsoft Office Online Server is available.
