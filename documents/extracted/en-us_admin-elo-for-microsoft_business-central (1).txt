ELO Integration Service for Business

Central

Introduction 

The ELO Integration Service for Business Central forms the technical platform for implementing the

ELO Integration Client in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central system (referred to as

Business Central in the rest of the document). Following installation, the ELO Integration Client is

available as a FactBox in correspondingly configured objects in the Business Central client. You will

find a list of the object pages extended with the ELO Integration Client under ELO Integration Client

integration points.

When the ELO Integration Client is called within Business Central, a configurable path is created

(assuming one doesn't already exist) and displayed in ELO. The functions of the ELO Integration

Client, which can also be customized if required, are available to users here.

The ELO Integration Service for Business Central is available for both on-premises and cloud

systems. Please note the different deployment methods within Business Central.

ELO basics 

To use the ELO Integration Service for Business Central and the ELO Integration Client within

Business Central, the ELO systems must meet the following requirements:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 and higher

Depending on the version, at least the following modules are required:

Business Central – On-Premises basics 

A module within Business Central is required for communication between ELO and Business

Central. This module has been developed in a separate ELO object range and therefore cannot

conflict with other developments.

The download contains a package for the ELO Integration Service for Business Central, which you

need to install in the Business Central Administration Shell. If you want to use this installation

package later on, you need to import a new license with the following modules in Business Central:

70670580 ELO Integration Service for Business Central

If you also use the ELO Output Link for Business Central, you must add the following module to the

license:

70670590 ELO Output Link for Business Central

To obtain these licenses, you must provide us with the Microsoft PartnerSource Business Center

account number of the partner who issues the licenses for the Business Central systems. This must

be an ELO authorized reseller of these two modules in the Microsoft PartnerSource Business Center.

Information

If you do not have a Microsoft PartnerSource Business Center account number, you must

contact the customer, the Business Central implementation partner, or the issuer of the

Business Central license.

Configuration in ELO 

First, you need to install and configure the ELO Integration Service for Business Central in the ELO

system.

You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration. The ELO

installation package contains the following files:

erp.mbc.integrationservice

erp.mbc.integrationservice.custom

The ELO Integration Client also requires a configuration file in the ELO app area.

elo.integration.Client

'elo.integration.client' configuration file 

To use the ELO Integration Client, you need the configuration file elo.integration.client in JSON

format, which is stored in the Administration folder. You will find this configuration file under this

path:

//Administration// ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.Client

If this file already exists because the ELO Integration Client is already being used in other systems,

you need to add the entry mbc. If it does not yet exist, create it with the following parameters. This

is important for calling the URL.

• 

• 

• 

{

  "mbc": {

    "noForm": false,

    "noFeed": false,

    "noFulltext": false,

    "noImagePreview": false,

    "rFInit": "RF_erp_mbc_integrationservice_service_Init",

    "newDocVersFct": true,

    "saveDocFct": true,

    "gotoFct": true,

    "webClientURL": "http://serverurl:serverport/ix-repository/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/web/"

    "editInOfficeFct": true,

    "removeEntryFct": true,

    "startWorkflowFct": false,

    "startWorkflowTemplates": null,

    "externalLinkFct": true,

    "folderMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E31)",

    "documentMask": "(E10E1000-E100-E100-E100-E10E10E10E30)",

6 ELO for Microsoft



Be sure to check the following parameters when creating or modifying the file:

rFInit: Function that creates the folder path in ELO; provided with the 

erp.mbc.integrationservice package.

webClientURL: URL to open the ELO Web Client when the Go to function is enabled. To

prevent the user from having to log on multiple times, the proxy behind the ELO Indexserver

must be configured. The ELO Web Client should be configured accordingly as a plug-in behind

the ELOix proxy (recommended method).

folderMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for Business Central

uses to create new structures based on the Business Central object.

documentMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for Business

Central uses when filing documents from the ELO Integration Client within Business Central.

You can use metadata forms that pass information onto the objects.

For more information on the parameters of this configuration file, refer to the documentation on the

ELO Integration Client.

Configuring ELO Integration Service for Business Central 

Once you have successfully installed the ELO packages, you will find the configuration app in the

ELO Administration Console under:

Solutions > ELO for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central > ELO Integration Service

Click the ELO Integration Service tile to access the configuration interface of the ELO Integration

Service for Business Central.

    "hasSearch": true,

    "referenceEntryFct": true,

    "refreshFct": true

  }

https://docs.elo.com/admin/integration-client/en-us/


In the first step, create a client or company on the Structures and folders tab. Once you have done

this, you will see the configuration area under Structures and folders where you can create the

following configurations:

Basic settings

General settings

Structure and metadata matching

Assignment of user and group rights

Basic settings 

If necessary, enable expert mode for the next configurations.

Integration Client URL

In this field, enter the full HTTP address that is initially used to call the ELO Integration Client. The

URL is structured as follows:

ELOix proxy address, path to ELOwf, and the ELO Integration Client app. The system comes at the

end as well as the ID created in the JSON configuration file.

Example:

• 

• 

• 

• 

http://mbcdemo:9090/ix-MBCDEMO/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/wf/apps/app/elo.integration.Client/?debug=fals

8 ELO for Microsoft



General settings 

Under General settings, you can create configurations for each Business Central object. As soon as

you add a new entry, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadata

matching area. Lines are also created in the Assignment of user and group rights area.

BC table: In the BC table column, enter the Business Central table name (database table) you want

to use.

Alias: The alias is a technical name you can define yourself. For example, you could copy the entry

from the BC table field without spaces. The alias is used for unique identification later on.

Object description: This field can be used to describe the entry, for example, if you want to provide

more information.

Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that may

have to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.

Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column, e.g. MBC folder

Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use when filing from Business

Central. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client configuration file, or a

separate one for each Business Central object.

Structure and metadata matching 

As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, a

separate entry for the alias is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching area.

Alias: This entry is copied directly from the Alias column under General settings and can also only

be modified in this area.

9 ELO for Microsoft



Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, you

can also enter Business Central variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax. You will find an example in

the chapter Implementation example 'SalesHeader'

ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata form

defined under Folder form (see chapter General settings). In our example, this is the form MBC

folder.

BC field name: Enter the name of the column in the BC table here.

Untranslated (expert mode): Enable this option to return the BC table values untranslated. These

are the so-called Options. Document Type is such a column, since the Document Type is transferred

either as an untranslated numerical value (e.g. 1 for orders) or as text in the current Business

Central language (order).

Mandatory field (expert mode): Enable this option if you want this field to be mandatory. For

example, this is important if you are using the value within a path. This can prevent incomplete

paths from being created in ELO.

ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for MAP fields and enter the technical

name of the field here. In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the

technical name. This is useful in relation to the value in Alternative table if a table of lines is

specified there and multiple values can be transferred.

If the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost and

written as a warning in the log.

Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELO

entry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curly

brackets.

If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.

Please note

If an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenated

in this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.

Parameter: The parameter for mapping from the URL is stored here.

Key field: You can select one key field per BC table. The value of the key field is used to specify a

property of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example,

you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. This ensures that an object is not created

twice (with a new name) in the repository, for example. Instead, the corresponding folder is found

and a new path is created according to the new name. The folder and its contents are moved to this

10 ELO for Microsoft



new path. The documents that were stored under the old name remain in the folder with the new

name.

Filter (expert mode): Enabling this field sets a filter within Business Central. This function can be

used if two entries have been created for Sales Header. For example, it is possible to restrict 

Document Type to use different configurations for orders and requests. Alternatively, you can also

make the distinction in the path itself using Handlebars.

Alternative BC table (expert mode): Enter an alternative table here. A primary key must be used to

establish a relation to the primary table. The classic case is the header table to line table relation,

for example, Sales Header as the leading table and Sales Lines as the alternative table.

Implementation example 'SalesHeader' 

General settings

BC table: Sales Header

Alias: SalesHeader

Object description: Sales Quote/(Blanket/Return) Order/Inv./Cr. Memo

Intermediate form: Folder

Folder form: MBC folder

Document form: Basic entry

Structure and metadata matching

Repository path:

ELO field matching:

Document Type: X Untranslated X Mandatory field

Field type: MAP

ELO field: DOCTYPE_PLAIN

Value in Handlebars:

Parameter in URL: DOCTYPEPLAIN Document Type: O Untranslated O Mandatory field

/MS Business Central/{{{Client}}}/Sales/{{#ifCond DOCTYPEPLAIN '==' '0'}}Quotes{{else}}{{#ifCond DOCTYPEPLA

• 

• 

• 

{{{DOCTYPEPLAIN}}}

• 

• 

11 ELO for Microsoft



Field type: MAP

ELO field: DOCTYPE

Value in Handlebars:

Parameter in URL: DOCTYPE No.: O Untranslated X Mandatory field

Field type: GRP

ELO field: MBC_DOC_NO

Value in Handlebars:

Parameter in URL: DOCNO 

In this example, a child folder with the name of the client and the fixed value //Sales//Orders is

created in the MS Business Central folder in ELO. Objects are stored in this folder under the 

DOCNUM. All values transferred with POSNO1, POSNO2 ...POSNOX are stored in the corresponding

MAP field POSITION_NO1, POSITION_NO2 ... POSITION_NOX.

Assignment of templates, user and group rights 

In this area, you can use a stored template (template structure) when using an entry for the first

time as well as assign user and group rights. The required template can be created in the

configuration area of Business Central under:

//Administration//Business Solutions Custom//erp.mbc.serviceintegration//Configuration//

FolderTemplates

• 

• 

{{{DOCTYPE}}}

• 

• 

• 

• 

{{{DOCNO}}}

• 

12 ELO for Microsoft



The template is only copied the first time the entry is created.

Path to template: Enter the path to the template structure here. For example, if you created a

template structure PurchaseOrder, this would mean that when you call the ELO Integration Client in

the Business Central purchase order object, assuming all conditions are met, the structure is

created under:

// Administration // Business Solutions Custom // erp.mbc.integrationservice // Configuration //

FolderTemplates // PurchaseOrder

At this point, you must use a separator to define a deeper folder structure. However, the separator

used must be leading, e. g. if you enter /Vendor/Orders, the slash is recognized as a separator.

Handlebars syntax is also allowed, which enables you to control templates flexibly.

If you use Handlebars syntax to create the structure, you can only use metadata from the fields of

the initial template, in this case MBC folder.

Rights for users and groups

Replace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the parent element by default. If the Replace rights option

is enabled, the rights of the parent element are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.

Please note that this function only works if a folder structure does not yet exist.

Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.

RWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.

R = View

W = Change metadata

D = Delete

E = Edit

L = Edit list

P = Set permissions

For more information, refer to the documentation Concept for assigning rights and permissions.

Working with multiple companies/databases 

If you work with multiple companies/databases in Business Central but want to manage them in a

single ELO repository, you can add an entry in the integrationservice.config file.

After you have confirmed the new entry, you will get an empty configuration interface.

You also have to create a new configuration entry in the configuration file elo.integration.Client to

address the new client. You could create an entry mbc2 as a copy of mbc and then also change the

URL. In the example we used, it would look like this (see also chapter 'elo.integration.client'

configuration file):

ELOix proxy address, path to ELOwf, and the ELO Integration Client app. The system comes at the

end as well as the ID created in the JSON configuration file.

Example:

Solutions folder can be overwritten.

After you create a client, the following areas appear for further configuration:

General settings

Structure and metadata matching

Assignment of user and group rights

General settings 

In the General settings area, you define an Identifier. In standard scenarios, this can be the report

ID, for example. With customer extensions within Business Central, this could also be an ID defined

by development. The identifier helps you identify the configuration entry. As soon as you add a new

entry in this area, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadata

matching and Assignment of user and group rights areas.

Identifier: In this column, you enter the report ID from Business Central, which is used to print

documents there, for example.

Structure alias: The structure alias is a technical name that you defined in the ELO Integration

Service for Business Central configuration. The alias is used for unique identification later on. It is

used to identify the base path where the document will be filed.

34 ELO for Microsoft



Object description: This field can be used to describe the entry, for example, if you want to provide

more information.

Version comment: The comment is entered for the document filed from Business Central and is

visible in the document's feed. If a report/an object is printed again, ELO generates a new version,

which is saved in the comment/feed with the entry configured here.

BC table: In the BC table column, enter the Business Central table name (database table) you want

to use.

Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use for documents filed via ELO

Output Link for Business Central. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client

configuration file, or a separate one for each Business Central object.

Print: A document is filed when a document is printed in Business Central.

Event: A document is filed when an event takes place that generates a report within Business

Central. The event in Business Central relates to the functions Send/Attach as PDF/Print.

Please note

Objects and reports that support the Event function within Business Central should not

activate the Print function. Otherwise, the document would be filed with two versions.

Printing can be used as a global event with Business Central.

Post: A document is filed when the object is posted in Business Central.

Please note

If technical errors are shown during posting in Business Central (within an object, for

example a customer order, that supports and has been configured for Output Link), Business

Central may not correctly forward the event to ELO and the printout of the document will not

be filed.

We therefore recommend combining the Post function with the job queue to file any

documents that have not been filed later on.

Manual: A document is filed when a separate function is called in Business Central (Send to ELO

button in Business Central).

Information

The filing functions are not available in all Business Central objects. You will find detailed

information on which Business Central flags/events there are implementations for in the

table Output Link integration points.

35 ELO for Microsoft



Only one version: No other versions will be filed. If a document already exists, the previous

metadata remain unchanged.

Job: As soon as this option is enabled, the configuration entry in a defined entry in the job queue in

Business Central is used for post-processing or automatic processing. See also Job queue.

Structure and metadata matching 

As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, a

separate entry for the identifier is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching

area.

Identifier: This entry is copied directly from the Identifier column under General settings and can

also only be modified in this area.

Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, you

can also enter Business Central variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.

Implementation example for Identifier 1305:

ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata form

defined under document form (see chapter General settings). In our example, this is the form MBC

PrintedOrder.

BC field name: Enter the name of the column in the BC table here.

Untranslated (expert mode): Enable this option to return the BC table values untranslated. These

are the so-called Options. Document Type is such a column, since the Document Type is transferred

either as an untranslated numerical value (e.g. 1 for orders) or as text in the current Business

Central language (order).

Mandatory field (expert mode): Enable this option if you want this field to be mandatory. For

example, this is important if you are using the value within a path This can prevent incomplete

paths from being created in ELO.

ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for MAP fields and enter the technical

name of the field here. In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the

technical name. This is useful in relation to the value in Alternative table if a table of lines is

specified there and multiple values can be transferred.

/Printed/{{{DOCNO}}}

36 ELO for Microsoft



If the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost and

written as a warning in the log.

Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELO

entry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curly

brackets.

If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.

Please note

If an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenated

in this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.

Parameter in URL: The parameter for mapping from the URL is stored here.

Filter (expert mode): Enabling this field sets a filter within Business Central. If two entries have

been created for Sales Header, for example, it is possible to restrict Document Type to use different

configurations for orders and requests. Alternatively, you can also make the distinction in the path

itself using Handlebars.

This filter is used in the context of processing the job queue entry (Job option enabled) (not yet

implemented).

Alternative BC table (expert mode): Enter an alternative table here. A primary key must be used to

establish a relation to the primary table. The classic case is the header table to line table relation,

for example, Sales Header as the leading table and Sales Lines as the alternative table.

Key field (expert mode): You can select one key field per BC table. The value of the key field is used

to specify a property of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes.

For example, you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. New versions of the object

are created at the new location when moving the object instead of creating it (and therefore a

duplicate) at the old location, for example.

Assignment of user and group rights 

This is where you assign user and group rights.

Rights for users and groups

Replace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the folder by default. If this option is enabled, the rights

of the folder are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.

Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.

37 ELO for Microsoft

Configuration in Business Central 

Deployment in Business Central – on-premises 

After you have completed the configuration in ELO, you need to install Business Central. You can do

the installation at the same time as the configuration in ELO. However, you need a corresponding

ELO configuration to be able to configure ELO Output Link for Business Central in Business Central.

The required installation files for Business Central are part of the download package, which you will

find in the ELO SupportWeb under Integration > MS Business Central.

Start the Business Central Administration Shell and deploy the installation package for ELO

Integration Service for Business Central. In the following example, the package was deployed using

these commands:

Publish-NAVApp

Sync-NAVApp

Implementation example:

Information

If you do not have a Microsoft PartnerSource Business Center account number, you must

contact the customer, the Business Central implementation partner, or the issuer of the

Business Central license.

Setup and extensions in Business Central on-premises 

After the deployment, log on in the Business Central system.

Go to the Setup & Extensions menu, and select the Extensions menu item.

After successful deployment, you can install the package.

Click Show more options (button with three dots) and then select the Install menu item.

Please note

Install ELO Integration Service for Business Central first, before ELO Output Link for

Business Central.

After the installation, log on to Business Central again.

Deployment in Business Central – Cloud 

Microsoft AppSource provides an ELO Output Link app for Business Central cloud systems.

You can search for the app in AppSource via the search in Business Central. Please note that this

requires administrator rights outside of Business Central.

Open the Extensions Marketplace from the search.

4. 

1. 

43 ELO for Microsoft



Enter ELO Output Link in the search field and select the app shown.

You will be forwarded to Microsoft AppSource and can download the app there.

First, check and confirm your Microsoft profile information.

3. 

44 ELO for Microsoft



Select the language you want to install the extension in.4. 

5. 

45 ELO for Microsoft



Begin installing the ELO Integration Service app on your Business Central Cloud system. In

the next step, you can configure the extension outside of Business Central.

Fix error while loading the configuration 

After successful installation, attempting to load the configuration from ELO may result in an error. In

this case, you will have to check the ELO Output Link extension settings and enable the function 

Allow HttpClient Request.

In Business Central, call the Extension Management function using the search.

Search for ELO Output Link within the installed extensions and select the option Configure

from the additional actions (button with three dots).

1. 

2.

Update apps in Business Central – Cloud 

To update the ELO app in Microsoft AppSource, perform the following steps:

Log on to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central browser client.

In the global search, enter Extension Management and select the corresponding link.

Select the ELO app.

1. 

2. 

3. 

48 ELO for Microsoft

Configuration of 'ELO Setup' in Business Central 

Once you have completed the installation and logged on again, you can search for the ELO Setup

configuration and click the entry to open it.

4. 

5. 

49 ELO for Microsoft



The General, Integration Service, and Debugging configuration areas are described in the

documentation for the ELO Integration Service for Business Central.

Please note

To be able to load the configuration and connect ELO to your Business Central Cloud system

later, the two systems have to be able to communicate. Either your ELO system or at least

the Indexserver URL used must be able to be reached externally, or you can configure an

alternative, such as a Microsoft Application Proxy. In any case, your Business Central System

will have to be able to reach the ELO system directly.

ELO Setup – Output Link 

In the next step, you need to create the ELO Output Link for Business Central configuration.

The Configuration path field is usually already completed. If you want to use a different

configuration in ELO, you can modify the configuration path. The configuration path in our example

is as follows:

/erp.mbc.outputlink/Configuration/outputlink.config

50 ELO for Microsoft



The Configuration entry field can be left blank if there is only one configuration entry in the 

outputlink.config file in ELO. In our example, Business Central uses this one configuration entry.

If multiple Business Central systems are connected, the corresponding ELO configuration can be

assigned via this configuration entry.

Load configuration

After you have created or checked the configuration path and, where applicable, specified a

configuration entry, you can import the ELO Output Link for Business Central configuration from the

ELO system to Business Central using the Actions menu item Load Output Link config. You must

have already completed the configuration in the ELO system (see chapter Configuring ELO Output

Link for Business Central).

Information

Business Central stores the configuration in the cache at this point, so you need to load the

configuration initially as well as when adjusting the configuration in ELO.

If Business Central successfully loaded the configuration, you will see a success message.

Last import

This menu item tells you when the configuration was last uploaded from the ELO system.

Enable

This function allows you to enable or disable ELO Output Link for Business Central.

51 ELO for Microsoft



ELO Setup – Check configuration 

Under the menu item Integration Service configuration (Integr. Serv. config.), you can view and

check the configured entries in ELO.

General 

Among other things, Business Central differentiates between two types of document reports:

reports in RDLC format (Report Definition Language, identifier beginning with 2xx for sales and 4xx

for purchasing scenarios, for example) and Word report layout (beginning with 130* for sales and

132* for purchasing). This has to be taken into consideration depending on the customer system

during creation. To find a used report ID within a Business Central object (for example a sales

order), the ID can be shown via page validation (keyboard shortcut: CTRL + ALT + F1) in the

corresponding report.

Information

In Business Central, the term Report is also used for certain external documents such as

sales invoices and order confirmations, which you send to customers as PDF files.

Source: Documentation for Microsoft Dynamics 365

For document reports, the ID can be analyzed via the Report Selection menu.

52 ELO for Microsoft

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layouts
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-manage-report-layouts


Via Report Selection – Sales you can view the reports selected: in this example, report ID 1307 –

Sales - Credit Memo (in RDLC format) for a credit. 

The report ID can now be applied to the Output Link configuration.

More information is available from the manufacturer (see source in the info box).

Information

In a customer production system, you may encounter customized reports that you will have

to configure as identifiers within ELO.

53 ELO for Microsoft



Job queue 

Within Business Central, you can use job queues to define static automated processes. These allow

you to perform activities within the system without requiring an action. Job queues do not react to

conditions within the system, but are instead automatically performed by the system itself based

on a defined pattern. For example, job queues can be used to automatically repeat any failed

transfers, for example when invoices aren't filed to ELO when printed because the server could not

be reached. Job queues can also be used to transfer documents that already exist to the ELO

system when introducing ELO at a company.

Please note

To use the job queue function, the Job box must be checked for the corresponding reports in

the ELO configuration.

Configuration in ELO 

To file the generated reports/documents in ELO, you will have to define multiple steps. First, you

have to define a field in the Output Link configuration where you can filter the date range for the

reports, for example. In our example, we use the field POSTING_DATE from Business Central for 

Sales invoice – report ID 1306.

The value $Job_Range$ also has to be entered in the Filter field in the Output Link configuration.

Information

After saving the configuration, remember to reload the scripts in ELO and to read the

configuration back into Business Central.

Additional filters applying to fixed values can also be defined, for example if you want to select

explicit reports. In the Filter field, enter the value of the corresponding DocType, for instance. You

can also enter an explicit date to the Filter field. In this case, only postings/reports on this day are

considered.

Configuration in Business Central 

Open the Job Queue Entries list in Business Central and create a new report. In the General area,

enable the Show more function and enter the required configurations.

54 ELO for Microsoft



Object Type to Run: CodeUnit

Object ID to Run: 70670677 (elo-ol-batchjobs)

Parameter String: 1 (as an example for 1 day back)

If you only want to run the report once, you can do so via Menu > Job > Restart. Once this is

executed, the created report is removed.

To configure repeats for this report, you can configure this job with the desired parameters in the 

Repeat area. You can check via the Job queue log entries whether they are being run.
