Aspects

Aspects 

The heart of the metadata (gen. 2) is formed by the aspects.

Aspects consist of fields and views. You can find default fields, e.g. Filing date, in the views area of

the form designer. For aspects to be shown in the client, you have to define at least one view per

aspect.

Information

Before creating metadata forms, it makes sense to create a plan of which aspects are

needed and which aspects may be able to be used in multiple metadata forms.

Metadata forms

Metadata forms 

Metadata forms allow you to classify ELO documents by different types. Metadata forms are the

framework that hold the aspects and fields together.

What follows in an explanation of the steps for adding new metadata forms and for configuring

their content, usage and default values.

To be able to use the aspects you previously created, you have to:

Create metadata forms

Assign aspects

Create views

Please note

When configuring metadata forms, the number of forms used should not reach double-digits.

A separate search index is built for each metadata form. A large number of metadata forms

therefore requires a large amount of RAM and hard disk space for the ELO iSearch.

This applies for first generation and second generation metadata forms.

14 ELO packages



Create metadata form 

In the menu area of the ELO Administration Console, click the package you want to edit.

The Metadata forms tab is selected automatically.

Click Add metadata form.

1. 

2. 

15 ELO packages



The Form dialog box opens.

16 ELO packages



Configure content 

If you create a new metadata form, a Content tab opens by default. Here, you can specify the

contents of metadata form properties, e.g. the technical names of forms, aspect mappings, views,

or dashboards.

Create overview 

Enter a technical name in the Identifier field.

Information

Only uppercase letters are possible.

Enter a translation variable into the Translation variable field.

Information

Option 1: Select one of the available translation variables from the drop-down menu.

The Name field is completed automatically.

1. 

2. 

17 ELO packages



Option 2: Generate a new translation variable via direct input. Then, enter a name in

the Name field and click the Save icon at the end of the field. The name is assigned to

the translation variable and stored in the translation variable database.

Optional: Click Edit inheritance to apply aspects and fields from one or more other metadata

forms as needed. You can then add to the aspects and create new views.

Click Apply.

Result

The metadata form is created.

3. 

4. 

18 ELO packages



Configure metadata forms 

Metadata forms have to be configured before you can use them.

Assign aspects 

To fill the metadata form with aspects and forms, you have to assign aspects to the metadata form.

19 ELO packages



Method

Click Add aspect mapping.

The Aspect mapping dialog box opens.

Click the Select aspect button.

The pick list of available aspects opens.

Select a suggestion.

Enter a technical name in the Identifier field.

Enter a translation variable into the Translation variable field.

Information

Option 1: Select one of the available translation variables from the drop-down menu.

The Name field is completed automatically.

Option 2: Generate a new translation variable via direct input. Then, enter a name in

the Name field and click the Save icon at the end of the field. The name is assigned to

the translation variable and stored in the translation variable database.

Option 1: If necessary, enable the option May be created multiple times.

If this option is enabled, the behavior of the aspect in the form changes. A plus icon appears

that can be used to add the aspect to the metadata form multiple times.

This can make sense if you've created an aspect for telephone numbers, for example.

Instead of creating a separate aspect for all types of telephone numbers, use a basic type

and enable the option May be created multiple times for it. Users can add as many telephone

numbers as they'd like, as needed.

Please note

The view for the aspect must be created with the List type if you want to enable the

option May be created multiple times for aspect mapping.

Option 2: If necessary, edit the permissions settings for the aspect mapping.

With the default settings, the aspect mapping can be used and seen by everyone.

Click Save to save the aspect mapping.

Add all the aspects you need for the metadata form in this way.
