ELO for SmartWe

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to set up the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe. This service

provides the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Client in SmartWe. Following

installation, the ELO Integration Client is available as an iframe in correspondingly configured

objects in the SmartWe application.

When the ELO Integration Client is called within SmartWe, a configurable path is created (assuming

one doesn't already exist) and displayed in ELO. This provides the user with the functions of the

ELO Integration Client, which can also be customized if required.

ELO basics 

To use the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe and the ELO Integration Client within SmartWe, the

systems must meet the following requirements:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 and higher

Depending on the version, at least the following modules are required: 

ELO 23: 

ELOwf 23.00.000

ELO 21: 

ELOwf 21.00.000

ELO 20: 

ELOwf 20.05.000

ELO 12: 

ELOwf 12.06.000

ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.13.000 or higher

Installed and configured ELOauth plug-in

ELO configuration 

First, you need to install and configure the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe in the ELO system.

You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration. The ELO

installation package contains the following files:

crm.csw.integrationservice

custom_crm.csw.integrationservice

The ELO Integration Client also requires a configuration file in ELOapps:

elo.integration.Client

'elo.integration.client' configuration file 

To use the ELO Integration Client, you need the configuration file elo.integration.client in JSON

format, which is stored in the Administration folder. You will find this configuration file under this

path:

//Administration//ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.Client

If it does not yet exist, create it with the following parameters. This is essential for calling

the client.

Alternative: If this file already exists because the ELO Integration Client is already being used

in other systems, you need to add the entry "csw".

Be sure to check the following important parameters when creating or modifying the file:

rFInit: Function that creates the folder path in ELO; provided with the

crm.csw.integrationservice package.

webClientURL: URL to open the ELO Web Client when the GoTo function is enabled. To

prevent the user from having to log on multiple times, the proxy behind the ELO

Indexserver must be configured. The ELO Web Client should be configured accordingly

as a plug-in behind the ELOix proxy (recommended method).

folderMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for SmartWe

uses to create new structures based on the SmartWe object.

documentMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for

SmartWe uses when filing documents from the ELO Integration Client within SmartWe.

You can use metadata forms that pass information onto the objects.

For more information on the parameters of this configuration file, refer to the technical

documentation on the ELO Integration Client.

Configuration of ELO Integration Client for SmartWe 

Once you have successfully installed the ELO packages, you will find the configuration app in the

ELO Administration Console under:

//Solutions//ELO for SmartWe//ELO Integration Service

    "hasSearch": true,

    "referenceEntryFct": true,

    "refreshFct": true

    }

}

General settings 

Under General settings, you can now create configurations for each SmartWe object. As soon as

you add a new entry, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadata

matching area. Lines are also created in the Assignment of user and group rights area.

Object: In the Object column, enter the name of the object you are creating the configuration for.

The selected object name must correspond to the SmartWe name of the object type (objectType

attribute in SmartWe) that you want to configure the object type for.

Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that may

have to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.

Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column. You have the option to

specify it with the GUID or the name of the metadata form.

Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use when filing from SmartWe.

You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client configuration file, or a separate one for

each SmartWe object.

Structure and metadata matching 

As described in the section General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, a

separate entry for the object is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching area.

Object: This entry is copied directly from the Object column under General settings and can also

only be modified in this area.

Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, you

can also enter SmartWe variables passed in the URL, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.

ELO field matching: This where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata form

defined under Folder form. In our example, it is the Folder metadata form. Choose between GRP for

metadata field and MAP for map fields and enter the technical name of the field here.

ELO field: In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the technical

name. This is useful for transferring multiple values for a parameter passed from SmartWe, for

example.

If the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost and

written as a warning in the log.

Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELO

entry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curly

brackets.

If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebars.

Please note

If an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenated

in this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.

Key field: You can select one key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a property of the

object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example, you can

specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object.

This ensures that an object is not created twice (with a new name) in the repository, for example.

Instead, the corresponding folder is found and a new path is created according to the new name.

The folder and its contents are moved to this new path. The documents that were stored under the

old name remain in the folder with the new name.

OAuth authentication 

ELO for SmartWe uses oAuth authentication to authenticate the SmartWe user. You therefore need

to install the ELOauth plug-in and configure it accordingly.

You can download the ELOauth plug-in on the ELO SupportWeb. The installation process is described

in the ELOauth plug-in documentation.

The plug-in is configured using a JSON file named de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json located in the ELO

Indexserver configuration directory:

Add the following entry to your ELOauth plugin-in configuration file and store your required values.

The clientUrl parameter is passed to the /login/ request. It is redirected after authentication to call

the ELO Integration Client or ELO Web Client, for example.

The parameter is available with ELOauth version 1.5.0.

The values you need to enter for appKey and appSecret are provided by ELO. The <smartWE

instance URL> can be taken from your browser. This is the URL used to call your SmartWe instance.

Example: https://beta.smartwe.de

In the example shown here, the mapping value is set to mail. This means that the system checks

whether the e-mail field of the ELO user matches an e-mail address transferred from SmartWe.

<ELO-Inst>/config/ix-<repository>/<server name>

{

"smartWe":{

     "clientUrl": "http(s)://<ELOSERVER>:<PORT>/ix-<REPOSITORY>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/wf/

                  apps/app/elo.integration.Client/?debug=false&system=csw",

    "mapping": "mail",

    "api": "default",

    "appKey":"elo-pkce-2cdbb0e0-01e0-45df-a9be-a853c35fd37f.smartwe.de",

    "appSecret":"eloPkce2022",

    "authorizationBaseUrl":"https://<URL smartWe Instanz>/identity/oauth/auth",

    "accessTokenEndpoint":"https://<URL smartWe Instanz>/identity/oauth/token",

    "userInfoEndpoint": "https://<URL smartWe Instanz>/identity/oauth/userinfo",

    "defaultScope": "openid email",

    "pkce": true,

    "userInfoJsonPath": "email"

    }

}
