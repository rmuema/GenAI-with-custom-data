Secure login via SNC 

To use secure transmission (SNC) with an RFC connection, you must take the following additional

setup steps.

First, a cryptography library (SAPCRYPTOLIB) must be provided on the ELO server. You can also find

information about this in SAP Note 1848999 in the SAP ONE Support Launchpad.

At the following link, you can download the current cryptography library that is suitable for the ELO

server architecture: SAP ONE Support Launchpad.

Save and extract the downloaded library to a new folder in the prog directory of your ELO server. In

our example, the path is E:\ELOenterprise\prog\SAP-Crypto-lib.

Set up Personal Security Environment 

A Personal Security Environment (PSE) is required for SNC encryption. This is a keystore or

truststore. It contains:

your own public key data, including your own private key

your own public key certificate

all public key certificates of the trusted communication partners

The SAPCryptoLib contains the sapgenpse tool. This is used to set up the PSE. The tool works with

the SECUDIR environment variable.

Create directory 

A separate directory is needed to store the PSE file. In our example, the directory sec was created

under the following path: E:\ELOenterprise\prog\SAP-Crypto-lib\sec.

Set SECUDIR environment variable 

The Tomcat needs to know where to find the PSE and credentials to use for SNC encryption.

You need to set the SECUDIR environment variable to the location of the PSE and credentials

(cred_v2).

Windows system variable 

SECUDIR is stored as a system variable in the Windows system properties under Environment

Variables.

Now you need to create your own certificate store (Personal Security Environment; PSE).

Create PSE 

There are two ways to create the PSE:

•

with an existing certificate

while simultaneously generating a self-signed certificate

For this scenario, create the PSE while simultaneously generating a self-signed certificate.

Create PSE and generate self-signed certificate 

The get_pse command is used to generate a PSE, a private key, and a public certificate. You need to

specify the distinguished name.

The -p option specifies the file name of the PSE you are creating. The distinguished name consists

of the following elements:

CN=<common name>

OU=<organizational unit>

O=<organization>

C=<country>

The full command could look like this:

In this case, you need to change the highlighted parameters to match your information.

When you execute the command, it requests the PIN for the PSE. Since the PSE is created at this

point, you can choose any pin you like. The sapgenpse tool creates a PSE in the selected directory

or in the SECUDIR directory. If you need to, you can generate a SigningRequest for the self-signed

certificate. However, you can also do this afterwards.

You can then have the certificate signed by a certificate authority and updated in the PSE.

The Tomcat service user that contains ELO Smart Link needs an access right.

Create access right for the Tomcat 

The Tomcat must have credentials at runtime to access the PSE. The seclogin command is used to

open the PSE and create credentials.

The -p option specifies the file name of the PSE you are creating.

The -O option specifies the user name (possibly including domain) that you are creating SSO

credentials for.

• 

sapgenpse get_pse -p <pse file> [other-options] [distinguished name]

• 

• 

• 

• 

sapgenpse get_pse -p ELOSLC.pse "CN=ELO Smart Link, C=DE"

sapgenpse seclogin -p <pse file> -O [<NT_domain>\]<user_ID>

The full command could look like this:

When you execute the command, it requests the PIN for the PSE. The sapgenpse tool then creates a

credentials file (cred_v2) in the SEC directory. If the file already exists, it is updated.

Exchange public key certificates 

To enable SNC communication, ELO and the SAP system must be able to identify each other. This is

done using the public key certificates that are stored in the PSE. To allow identification, the SAP

public key certificate must be stored in the ELO PSE, and vice versa.

If SNC encryption is used to communicate with multiple SAP systems, the public key certificates for

all of these SAP systems must be imported.

Export your own certificate 

If you generated a new certificate with the sapgenpse tool, the public key certificate can be

exported with the export_own_cert command.

The -o option specifies the file name of the exported certificate.

The -p option specifies the file name of the PSE you are creating.

The full command could look like this:

When you execute the command, it requests the PIN for the PSE. The sapgenpse tool then stores

the public key certificate under the specified file name.

Export SAP certificate 

In the SAP system, switch to the transaction STRUST.

Open the SNC SAPCryptolib menu item.

sapgenpse seclogin -p ELOSLC.pse -O SYSTEM

sapgenpse export_own_cert -o <output file> -p <pse file>

sapgenpse export_own_cert -o smartLink.cer -p ELOSLC.pse

Double-click your own certificate to select it.

In the lower part of the certificate information, select the Export certificate button and enter

an export path.

Import your own ELO certificate 

Within the STRUST transaction in the SAP system, you also have the option to import the certificate

you just exported from the ELO system.

Select the Import certificate button.

Select the file path where you saved the certificate.

Select the Add to Certificate List button and save the steps afterwards.

Import certificate from SAP 

The maintain_pk command is used to import the certificate from the SAP system.

The -a option specifies the file name of the certificate being imported.

The -p option specifies the file name of the PSE you are creating.

The full command could look like this:

When you execute the command, it requests the PIN for the PSE. The sapgenpse tool then imports

the public key certificate into the PSE.

Enter the parameters in SAP 

Open transaction SU01 in SAP and call the corresponding ELO Smart Link user. Switch to the SNC

tab and enter the SNC name in the SNC name field.

Enter the parameters in ELO Smart Link 

Now enter the defined parameters.

Level: Specifies the security level to use for the connection. Possible values:

1: Authentication only

2: Integrity protection

3: Privacy protection

Own name: Your own SNC name can be read from the distinguished name in the public key

certificate which was used when creating the PSE. The SNC name has the format 

p:<distinguished_name>.

SAP system name: The name of the SAP system. The name can be read from the distinguished

name in the public key certificate of the SAP system. The SNC name has the format 

p:<distinguished_name>.

Path to the cryptography library (on ELO server): Specifies the cryptography library path and file

name. It must be a valid path on the ELO server where the SAP Java Connector (JCo) can address

the library.

If all parameters have been configured and the respective certificates have been exchanged, the

ELO and SAP systems can now use SNC.
