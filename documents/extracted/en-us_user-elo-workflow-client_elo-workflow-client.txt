3 ELO Workflow Client



Basics 

The ELO Workflow Client is an ELO client for approving workflows.

Tasks appear in your task list. You can see which tasks have been escalated, the priority level, and

other important data. You can edit tasks for different entry types. For example, if a task is part of a

folder entry, you can navigate the folder hierarchy. The ELO Workflow Client allows you to process

form-based tasks.

This chapter covers the following topics:

Installation

Program interface

Installation 

The ELO Workflow Client installs automatically with your license. The ELO Workflow Client does not

have to be installed separately.

Access to the ELO Workflow Client works through a URL. You can create a desktop shortcut to the

URL or bookmark it in your browser. The URL is provided by your administrator.

Start ELO Workflow Client 

To start the ELO Workflow Client, enter the URL in your browser.

Enter your logon credentials. If you have been given a temporary password to log on with, change

it during the first session using the Change password function.

Information

If you have forgotten your password, contact your system administrator.

If functional roles have been defined for you, you can enable or disable them here.

If you disable your functional roles, all access and user rights associated with the role cannot be

used during the session. This makes it easier to navigate the program and allows you to focus on

tasks beyond the scope of the role.

Functions 

This chapter explains the different functions of the ELO Workflow Client in detail. You are guided

through the most important steps.

Accept workflow 

To edit a workflow in the ELO Workflow Client, you must first accept the task. This prevents multiple

users from being able to work on the same workflow at the same time.

Information

The task has to be a group task.

Click on the workflow in your task list.

On the ribbon, select Accept workflow.

The lock is removed and you can edit the task.

Once you have accepted the task, it is removed from the task list of the other members of the

group. You can use the Return workflow function to undo this action.

If the Accept workflow button is grayed out, this can be for one of the following reasons:

The workflow is not a group task.

You have already accepted the workflow.

Delegate workflow 

This function enables you to delegate the workflow to another user/group.

If the Return workflow button is grayed out, this can be for one of the following reasons:

The workflow is not a group task.

You have not accepted the group task.

24 ELO Workflow Client



You received the workflow as part of a group so you have to accept it before you can forward

it.

form.

Unsaved changes 

If you close the form without saving it, the following dialog box appears:

Tips and tricks 

This chapter covers tips and tricks for using the ELO Workflow Client.

Refresh 

New tasks will show up in your list of tasks if you refresh the list. Do this regularly to make sure

you don't miss any new tasks.

Information

When you do a refresh, ELO jumps to the top entry in the task list.

Views (Form/Entry) 

You can switch between the views with the Form and Entry buttons.

Views (Document/Full text) 

You can switch between the views with the Document and Full text buttons.

Viewer pane 

If a document cannot be displayed in the viewer pane, you can save the document on your

computer and open it there.

Please note

If you download and edit a document, the changes in the workflow document are NOT

visible in the ELO Workflow Client or to your colleagues. You CANNOT upload the modified

document back into the ELO Workflow Client.

Escalated workflow 

It is possible to set a time limit for tasks. If this time limit is reached before you complete the

workflow step, the task is escalated. You can see what time limit was set by the due date in the

task list. An overdue workflow features a red icon with a white exclamation mark in your task list.

Information

If the escalated workflow is a group task, you can hide it by removing the check mark.

27 ELO Workflow Client



Feed 

With form-based tasks, the feed is only displayed if you selected the Entry button in the top right

corner. If you selected the Form view button, the form and other actions are displayed in the viewer

pane.

You can recognize a new post by a green dot in front of the name of the author.

The feed is an important communication tool. You can see in the feed whether changes have been

made to the entry or if another user with access to the repository is editing the entry.

Please note

You do not receive any notifications. To see this information, you need to check the feed of

the respective workflow from your task list.

You can create a reference and see references created by other users in a post or comment.

Information

You cannot access the references in posts or comments.

You can subscribe to the feed for an entry in a workflow.

Please note

Your subscription to a feed related to a specific entry is limited to the period in which the

workflow is assigned to you. Once you have forwarded the workflow, you will no longer see

the feed you subscribed to.

Form task 

A form task can contain a form that you can edit yourself or one that is already completed.

Be sure to save the changes in the form associated with a form-based task. You will get a reminder

when you close the form.

You need to forward form tasks with the buttons in the viewer pane, not with the Forward workflow

button on the ribbon.

Group tasks 

Make sure that you enable the check mark for group tasks so that you see all workflows in your

task list.

28 ELO Workflow Client



Inactive buttons 

Not all buttons are active at the same time. Make sure that the following requirements are met:

Accept workflow: The workflow must be a group task.

Forward workflow: In the case of a group task, you have to accept the workflow first. With a form

task, forward the workflow by clicking one of the buttons on the form in the viewer pane.

Return workflow: The workflow must be a group task that you have already accepted.

Folder as part of a workflow 

If a folder is part of a workflow in your task list, you can navigate between the individual levels in

this folder as normal.

To return to a previous level, use the list of individual levels above the viewer pane. The levels are

separated by slashes. Click to select a level.
