Repository 

The structure and appearance of the repository depend greatly on your specific configuration. The

default state is described here.

Fig.: Contract management in the repository

Contracts are filed to // Contract management // Contracts // [Contract type].

You will also find references to contracts in dynamic folders. You can use these folders to search for

specific contracts, such as by status.

Contract types 

All contracts must be based on a contract type. Depending on the contract type, information is

automatically entered when filing a contract.

contract type has been configured, which is then selected automatically.
