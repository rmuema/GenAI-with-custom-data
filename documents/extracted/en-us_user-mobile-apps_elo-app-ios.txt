2 ELO mobile apps



Basics 

With the ELO app, you can access your company's ELO repository using a mobile device. The app

offers quick access to your documents and all associated details. You can capture and file

documents while out of the office and search for information in your ELO repository.

The ELO app does not replace the desktop version of ELO, but is designed to complement it. To get

the most out of the ELO app, you should already be familiar with the basic functions of ELO

software as well as your device.

The ELO app is optimized for use on an iPad in landscape mode. This documentation explains how

to use the app with an iPad. It may look different on your device.

Internet. For more information, refer to the ELO Web Client Internet Access developer

documentation.

Active Internet connection for unlimited functionality

network. Without SSL/TLS encryption, third parties could intercept this data.

Data sets 

Data sets enable you to enter data in a form and save it to ELO. You can also save data in forms

without an Internet connection. You can transfer the data sets as soon as your device is connected

to ELO.

Requirements 

To work with data sets, you need a metadata form with the corresponding settings and a specific

form.

Metadata form 

When submitting data with ELO for Mobile Devices, all data is saved to a metadata form. Create a

separate metadata form for each form you want to enter data with. To do so, use the ELO

Administration Console.

The layout of the metadata form depends on the data you want to submit. Use the metadata form

to define:

The fields for submitting data

The filing path for the data sets (filing definition) you created

Whether you can add one or multiple files to the data set (form type)

Fields 

Add a field and the associated group for each data field that you want to include in the form. These

fields are linked to the form. The user enters data to the fields via the form in the app.

Filing definition 

Create a filing definition so that the data sets can be uploaded to ELO. The data sets cannot be filed

to the repository without a filing definition.

Form type 

The form type specifies whether the data set is created as a document or as a folder. You can select

the following settings:

Usage > Folders: If this option is enabled, data sets are created as folders. You can attach

multiple files to a data set. However, you do not have to attach a file. Attachments are filed

with the Basic entry metadata form.

Usage > Documents: If this option is enabled, data sets are created as documents. You must

attach a file. You cannot attach more than one file.

If both options are selected, the conditions for the Usage – Documents option will apply.

Form 

You need a specific form to create a data set. You create this form using the ELO form designer in

the ELO Administration Console or in the ELO Java Client.

Information

For detailed information on forms, refer to the ELO Java Client Workflow manual.

Please note

Data set forms are intended for offline use. This means you cannot use functions that

require a connection to the ELO Indexserver, such as ELOas rules or dynamic keyword lists.

Please note

A data set form must be created as a separate template. Data set forms must not be

divided into tab groups.

A data set form must meet the following criteria:

Form name: The name of the form must follow this pattern: offline_<NAME>. Replace 

<NAME> as required.

Template: The form requires a template. The name of the template must be composed

according to the following outline: main_<NAME>. Replace <NAME> as required.

The names of the form and the template do not need to match.

Connecting metadata forms 

You need to link the template to a suitable metadata form (see above).

Method

Open the template in the ELO form designer.

Alternative: The changes are also applied when you save the template.

Result
