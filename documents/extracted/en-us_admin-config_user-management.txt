User

Overview 

Everyone who uses ELO needs a corresponding ELO account. These accounts are created,

configured, and managed in the User manager.

Open the user manager in the ELO Administration Console via (System settings > User manager).

The User manager offers the following actions:

1 Create user

2 Perform search

3 Define filter

4 Copy user: All configurations are applied, with the exception of the Name, E-mail address, 

Password, and Windows user fields.

5 Perform configuration: Via the Basic settings, Group membership, and User rights tabs

6Delete user

Delete user 

Please note

4 Configuration and administration



When you delete a user, they are deleted permanently.

Do not delete any users that have already been used in ELO. This can lead to inconsistencies. In

this case, it is better to change the basic settings of the user instead of deleting the user:

Enable Lock account

Disable Allow interactive logon

Disable Visible in user lists

The user can no longer log on to ELO and is not visible to other users. They now only exist in the

background in ELO. Their previous actions, for example feed posts or entries in the document

versions, are still visible in ELO.

7 Configuration and administration



Use: 

Lock account: If this option is enabled, this user will no longer be able to log on to the

system. The user account is locked out of the system completely. However, this does

not mean that locked user accounts are no longer visible in the system. If you want

these accounts to be hidden, you need to disable the option Visible in user lists.

Visible in user lists: If this option is enabled, the user will show up in dialog boxes in

the ELO client. If the option is disabled, the user profile still exists in ELO, but users

without administrator privileges are unable to select them in dialog boxes.

Information

The users in an organizational unit only see the users within their own

organizational unit.

Users without this basic setting configured can still occur as field values in tables and

lists. For example, as in the "Filed by" option for documents, or as a field value in a

user field.

In the ELO Administration Console, users with the rights Main administrator and Edit

user data can see users who are otherwise not Visible in user lists. This also applies to

administration tasks, such as configuration, workflows, substitutions, in the client.

Interactive logon allowed: This option enables the user to log on to the ELO client.

Please note

This setting cannot be checked by the server. It is not considered a lock and can

be bypassed.

GUID: Each user is automatically assigned a GUID. The GUID can be used to address the user

in other functions.

Define group membership 

In the Group membership area, you can add the user to one or more groups.

•

10 Configuration and administration



With the Copy group membership from field, you can inherit the group memberships from another

user or group. Group memberships can also be added manually. Users are always members of the 

Everyone group.

Information

If you type a space in an input field, the entire list of available users and groups will be

displayed.

Assign user rights 

In the User rights area, you can configure rights for users.

11 Configuration and administration



1 Copy user rights from: Inherit the user rights from another user or a group

2 User rights: You will find more information under Rights in ELO > User rights.

Information

Ideally, all rights are inherited by the users through their membership in groups. This

simplifies administration and prevents users from having rights they don't need.

12 Configuration and administration



Groups

Overview 

Groups can be used to manage permissions and basic settings in ELO. Groups are also used in

workflows and for substitution rules.

Open the group manager in the ELO Administration Console via System settings > Group manager.

The Group manager offers the following actions:

1 Create group

2 Perform search

3 Define filter

4 Copy group: All configurations are applied, with the exception of the Name and E-mail address

fields.

5 Perform configuration: Via the Basic settings, Group membership, and User rights tabs

6 Delete group

Delete group 

Please note

When you delete a group, it is deleted permanently.

13 Configuration and administration



Do not delete any groups that have already been used in ELO. This can lead to inconsistencies. In

this case, it is better to change the basic settings of the group instead of deleting the group:

Disable Visible in user lists

The group now only exists in the background in ELO. The rights assigned via the group are

maintained and previous actions with this group, such as participation in workflows, are still visible

in ELO.

• 

14 Configuration and administration



Create group 

To create a group, proceed as follows:

Open the ELO Administration Console.

Open the group manager (System settings > Group manager).

Select New group.

The Group area opens.

Configure the new group. Navigate to the Basic settings, Group membership, and User rights

tabs to do so.

For more information, refer to the Configuration chapter.

Once you are finished with configuration, select Save group to save it.

You have created a new group.

16 Configuration and administration



Option group: Option groups are defined for the purpose of assigning specific 

ProfileOpts. Only these groups show up in dialog boxes where settings are made for

other ELO accounts.

For more information on option groups, refer to Option groups.

Substitution allowed: You can control how rights are distributed via the substitution

module. For groups that have the substitution right, rights can be transferred to

substitutes.

Functional role: If this option is enabled, members of this group are asked during logon

whether they want to assume the functional role for the current session. This allows

users to decide whether they want to use ELO in a specific role. 

This option makes sense if a user has to perform different tasks in ELO that require

different permissions and rights.

Information 

Last changed on: Is updated automatically.

GUID: Each group is automatically assigned a GUID. The GUID can be used to address the

group in other functions.

Option groups 

User-specific options are generally assigned to a user. However, group options are applied if there

are no user-specific options. If these have not been defined, then the settings for the Everyone

group are applied. If settings have not been defined for this group, there is also an ELO default

value (company default setting).

These groups allow you to control who has access to specific functions.

• 

• 

18 Configuration and administration



You can define which users can execute ELO functions from the context menu, or only from the

ribbon buttons, or both at once, and can even block access to parts of the software. It is also

possible to control scripts and script functions as well as icons for each option group.

This is practical for ELO workstations with special areas of responsibility, in order to improve

usability and to prevent incorrect usage.

Please note

An ELO user should only be a member of one option group. Memberships in multiple option

groups can result in conflicting settings.

Define group membership 

In the Group membership area, you can assign members to the group and define the group

membership in existing groups.

1 Members: Add existing users or groups as members

2 Group membership: With the Copy group membership from field, you can inherit existing group

memberships from other groups or users. Group memberships can also be added manually. The 

Everyone group is entered by default.

Information

19 Configuration and administration



Groups can be incorporated into other groups. This allows you to implement complex

combinations of rights settings and permissions concepts.

Information

If you type a space in an input field, the entire list of available users and groups will be

displayed.

Assign user rights 

Under User rights, you assign the rights associated with the group membership.

Password rules 

In the Password rules area (Maintenance > Password rules), you define the password security

settings.

Days valid: Define the number of days that passwords are valid.

Min. length: Define the minimum length for passwords in ELO.

Information

The more characters and special characters are used, the more secure the password is. You

can define which characters must be used in the password.

23 Configuration and administration



Block access 

Under Block access (Others > Block access), you can restrict access to ELO based on membership

of a selected group.

Access for group: ELO suggests possible groups as soon as you start typing in this field. Select a

group and click Save to confirm your selection. The respective repository can then only be

accessed by members of this group.

Please note

Users with the user right Main administrator are always able to log on to ELO. Users who are

already logged on can continue to use ELO until they log off.

Information

To grant all users access to the repository, use the Everyone group.

24 Configuration and administration



Organizational units 

Open the organizational units in the ELO Administration Console under System settings >

Organizational units.

Organizational units provide a way to classify users.

The users in an organizational unit only see the users within their own organizational unit.

This can be useful at big companies, e.g. if the branches in different countries do not work together

directly. A user or a group can only belong to one organizational unit. Membership to an

organizational unit can be inherited through groups.

Information

The same user should not be a member of different organizational units. Example: Three

different organizational units should not all contain the user Admin.

25 Configuration and administration



Rights in ELO

Introduction 

In ELO, individual users and groups can be assigned user rights. These tools enable the

administrator to control who has the authority to perform specific actions in ELO. Assigning these

rights ensures that only users with the corresponding rights may make settings and changes.

The inheritance of rights makes it easier to assign and manage rights.

There are additional configurations that can be made based on certain rights.

26 Configuration and administration



User rights 

You can manage user rights in the user and group configurations.

Information

Ideally, you should use groups to assign rights. This simplifies administration and prevents

users from having rights they don't need.

User manager rights 

Main administrator (FLAG_ADMIN) 

Administrator privileges are required to make global settings.

For example, a user with the right Edit user data and the additional right Main administrator can

administer all users instead of just those who that user is set as administrator of. Users with the

right Main administrator can still see all users, even those who are not Visible in user lists.

The right Main administrator allows you to change the permissions of the top repository level: To

change the permissions and options of the top level, you need to open the Set permissions dialog

box, which you can only do if you have the right Main administrator. To modify the permissions,

however, you also need the Edit permissions right.

The Main administrator right enables you to:

Delete entries permanently, even if you do not have the rights Delete folders, Delete

documents, Delete versions, and Delete non-modifiable documents.

A main administrator can remove a lock on any entry made by any user.

Assign substitutes for other users

27 Configuration and administration



Manage views and preview profiles, even for other users

Delete metadata forms

Log on in administration mode or when repositories are locked

You will find more information under Rights in ELO > Configuration > Necessary rights for the ELO

Administration Console.

Edit user data (FLAG_SUBADMIN) 

This option gives the user the right to create and manage other users. However, new users can only

be conferred the same (or fewer) rights as the user who created them.

This right is required if a user is registered as an administrator for other users. Only a user with this

right can administer user rights. User data can only be viewed and edited by the administrator of

the respective user. It is also possible to assign administrator privileges to a group. In this case, all

members of this group with the right Edit user data can administer this user or group. Only users

with Main administrator and Edit user data rights can see and administer all users. You can only

assign groups in which the user is a member or is administrator of. You can only edit your own user

data if you have the right Main administrator or you are set as an administrator in the user

manager.

With this right, it is possible to set substitution rules for other users that you are an administrator

of, even if they are not Visible in user lists.

Change password (FLAG_CHANGEPW) 

This right enables a user to change their own password for logging on to the system.

SAP administrator (FLAG_SAPADMIN) 

This right is required for enabling the link between the ELO Suite and SAP using ELO Suite for SAP

ArchiveLink® and allows you to manage the metadata form associated with the interface to SAP.

The metadata form for SAP-administered documents can be viewed by every user but can only be

edited by users with this right.

DMS Desktop user, no workflows (FLAG2_IS_DMS_DESKTOP_USER) 

If this option is enabled, the user does not have access to workflow functions.

Ad hoc workflow

Extend workflow deadline

Please note

This right is not technically a "right," but rather a restriction that supersedes all other rights

associated with workflows. A user with this right is unable to use the functions and roles

associated with workflows, irrespective of whether the individual rights are set or inherited

by a user or not. The user is also unable to edit any workflow tasks that are assigned to

them. This is because the ELO DMS Desktop does not include workflow functions. 

ELO Desktop Client Plus user (FLAG2_DESKTOP_CLIENT_PLUS) 

This right runs the ELO Desktop Client in advanced mode, with some task functionalities and the

full client view mode.

Please note

This is not technically a right, but limits what functions are available to the user.

ELOxc Client user, e-mails only (FLAG2_LIMITED_CLIENT) 

This right opens the ELO Client for Microsoft Outlook in ELOxc for Microsoft EWS mode, and is

restricted to the file formats (EML, MSG, and VCF) that can be opened by Microsoft Outlook. No

other formats are available to the user.

Please note

This is not technically a right, but limits what functions are available to the user.

29 Configuration and administration



Folder/document permissions 

Edit folders (FLAG_EDITSTRUCTURE) 

This option permits a user to edit the structure of folders or create new folders.

Edit documents (FLAG_EDITDOCS) 

This right enables users to edit documents. This includes the functions:

Load new versions

Check files in and out

Insert files

Documents from templates

Add and delete attachments

Add to full text database

Delete from full text database

Create signature

Users are only able to edit document metadata if they have the corresponding right. Otherwise, the

user can only open the metadata in read-only mode.

Edit permissions (FLAG_EDITACL) 

This right allows users to change the permissions to entries (documents and folders) in ELO.

Information

In order to be able to modify the permissions to entries, you need the right Edit folders or 

Edit documents. You also need the Set permissions (P) permission for each individual entry.

30 Configuration and administration



Users have the option to configure the rights when filing entries in the client, since they have full

rights to the file. The user right applies to subsequent editing of permissions.

It does not apply to the permission settings in the ELO Administration Console or the ELO Java

Client configuration. If users can edit the stamp, metadata forms, etc., they can also edit their

permissions without this user right being checked.

View all entries, ignore permissions (FLAG_IGNOREACL) 

This right means that the user can view all documents and folders, even if the user does not have

access to them. It revokes all existing object permissions. Users with this right have full access

permissions to all ELO entries.

The only way to protect documents from users who possess this user right is to encrypt them.

Import permission (FLAG_IMPORT) 

This right allows users to import a data set into the repository. All data available in the data set will

be imported — object permissions are ignored. The user performing the action therefore also

imports data that they do not have permissions to. This data will not be visible to the user.

Export permission (FLAG_EXPORT) 

This right enables the user to create a data set for export. The user can only export entries and

documents that they have the corresponding permissions to.

Folder/document options 

Information

31 Configuration and administration



The rights in this group (except Change document path) only apply if the right Edit folders or

Edit documents also exists.

Change metadata form after filing (FLAG_CHANGEMASK) 

This right allows the user to assign a different metadata form to a document already filed to the

repository. Please note that doing this may cause metadata to be lost. This is only possible if the

user also has the right Edit folders or Edit documents, depending on the entry.

Edit keyword lists (FLAG_EDITSWL) 

This right enables the user to add, change, and delete entries to the keyword list. The user is able

to add, change, and delete entries. If the user does not have this right, they will not be able to edit

the keyword lists in the ELO Administration Console, even if they have the right Edit metadata

forms and fields.

This is only possible if the user also has the right Edit folders or Edit documents, depending on the

entry.

Edit retention period (FLAG_EDITDUEDATE) 

This right enables the user to set and extend the retention period for documents. If the user does

not have this right, the corresponding field in the "Metadata" dialog box is disabled.

This is only possible if the user also has the right Edit folders or Edit documents, depending on the

entry.

Change document status (FLAG_CHANGEREV) 

This right enables the user to set the document status on the Options tab in the Metadata dialog

box.

Version control disabled

Version control enabled

Non-modifiable

This is only possible if the user also has the right Edit documents.

Change document paths (FLAG_CHANGEPATH) 

This right gives users access to the selection list for the document path in the document options

and enables them to change the path for a specific document. This is only possible when entering

metadata in the Intray. If a document has already been filed, this selection list is permanently

deactivated. If this is the case, you can only move documents to a different path using the Move

document files function if you have main administrator rights.

This right does not allow users to create new document paths or change their definition. Editing,

creating, and assigning document paths requires main administrator rights.

• 

•

32 Configuration and administration



Author for approval documents (FLAG_AUTHOR) 

This right allows the user to select or deselect the Approval document check box and edit approval

documents. The author is able to continue editing previous versions of a document. When users

check out documents, they are able to select all document versions. When documents are checked

in, the old working version is retained. The working version (= approved version) can only be

changed by authors for approval documents.

This is only possible if the user also has the right Edit documents.

Show "Additional information" tab (FLAG2_SHOW_EXTRA_INFO) 

This right determines whether a user is able to see the Additional information tab in the Metadata

dialog box.

This is only possible if the user also has the right Edit folders or Edit documents, depending on the

entry.

Deletion rights 

Delete folders (FLAG_DELSTRUC) 

This right determines whether a user is able to delete folders.

Delete documents (FLAG_DELDOC) 

This right determines whether a user is able to delete documents.

33 Configuration and administration



Delete non-modifiable documents (FLAG_DELREADONLY) 

This right enables the user to delete documents that have been filed with the status Non-modifiable

or have been awarded this status at some point.

This is only possible if the user has the right Delete documents.

Delete versions (FLAG_DELVERSION) 

This right allows the user to delete individual versions from a document's version history.

In the ELO Java Client, the user can see the deleted versions of a document in the Document

versions dialog box if the Show deleted entries function is enabled.

Workflow rights 

Manage workflows (FLAG_EDITWF) 

This right enables users to:

Create workflow templates and forms

Cancel active workflows before they are completed

Delete completed and canceled workflows permanently

Edit successor nodes

Start workflows (FLAG_STARTWF) 

This right allows a user to start workflows. This applies for the following functions:

Ad hoc workflow

Workflow overview

Start workflow

Workflows for this entry

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

34 Configuration and administration



The user also requires this right to start workflows when filing entries with a metadata form that is

linked to a workflow. If the user does not have this right, the user may file documents with this

metadata form but cannot start a workflow.

Without this right, the user will not be able to use the Workflow overview and the Workflows for this

entry functions on the ribbon of the ELO client. These functions provide the user with an overview

of all workflows that they are involved in either directly or indirectly (through group membership).

Extend workflow rights (FLAG2_EXTEND_WORKFLOW_RIGHTS) 

Users with this right have temporary read access to the entry assigned to the active workflow

node. The document can only be viewed in the Tasks work area, and only as long as the document

is assigned to the user or a group that the user is a member of. If this right is set, the user is given

temporary read rights to the entry assigned to a workflow. In addition, an entry in the database

table ProfileOpts gives the user the option to control whether temporary or permanent permissions

are to be assigned.

This right cannot replace other user rights, even those that are temporary. The right applies to

documents and folders, but not to metadata forms.

View workflows for all users (FLAG2_WF_CONTROLLER) 

This right allows the users to see all workflows that are active and not just those workflows that the

user is participating in.

Rights for system settings 

Edit master data (FLAG_EDITCONFIG) 

This right gives the user access to entry types (icons and names of folders and documents), font

colors, and stamps.

35 Configuration and administration



Edit scan profiles (FLAG_EDITSCAN) 

When this option is enabled, the user can change the settings for the scanner parameters and scan

profiles. If the user also has Main administrator privileges, they are also able to manage and edit

global scan profiles and the scan parameters for other users.

Use debugger (FLAG_EDITSCRIPT) 

If you have this right, you can open the JavaScript debugger in the ELO Java Client with the

keyboard command Ctrl+Alt+D.

Information

Scripts are managed like documents in ELO. To edit scripts, you need the corresponding

permissions.

Edit metadata forms and fields (FLAG_EDITMASK) 

This right enables the user to create new metadata forms and modify existing ones.

If you need to edit the keyword lists in the metadata forms, then you also need the right Edit

keyword lists.

Assign replication sets (FLAG_EDITREPL) 

You require this right for assigning data to replication sets in the repository. Replication sets are

needed by ELO Replication to determine data quantities.

36 Configuration and administration



Inheriting rights 

There are two check boxes in front of the user rights. The left check box refers to the user's

personal permissions. The check box to the right shows the rights a user takes on by belonging to a

group. If you move the mouse over the right check box, a tooltip appears telling you which groups

the right was inherited from.

Information

It is recommended to assign the rights via group inheritance and by directly assigning the

rights to the individual users.

37 Configuration and administration



Assign permissions in ELO Spaces 

The rights for the teamspaces and workspaces in ELO are determined based on the assigned roles.

Teamspace 

You can assign the following special teamspace rights to a role:

Edit roles: Edit and create roles in the teamspace, regardless of whether the teamspace itself

may be edited.

Edit teamspace: Make changes to a teamspace. They can also change the roles assigned to

members in the teamspace and add new members.

Delete teamspace: Can only be enabled if Edit teamspace is also enabled.

For more information on the roles in the teamspace, refer to the ELO teamspaces documentation.

Workspace 

You can assign the following special workspace rights to a role:

Edit workspace: Make changes to a workspace. They can also change the roles assigned to

members in the workspace and add new members.

Edit roles: Edit and create roles in the workspace. Can only be enabled if Edit workspace is

also enabled.

Delete workspace: Can only be enabled if Edit workspace is also enabled.

For more information on the roles in the workspace, refer to the ELO workspaces documentation.

Document encryption 

ELO systems provide a method to encrypt documents. These documents are encrypted at the

operating system level and can only be opened with a password, ensuring that documents are

safeguarded against unauthorized access, even when performing data backups.

In addition to the ACL authorization settings in ELO, you can encrypt documents that contain

confidential or sensitive information. This also protects documents from being viewed by

administrators at the operating system level.

Starting with ELO version 12, documents are encrypted with AES-256 (Advanced Encryption

Standard), a symmetric encryption method that uses block encryption. There are now more than 16

encryption keys. Encryption and decryption take place on the server side.

Documents that have already been encrypted remain in the old encryption mode. Both encryption

methods are listed in the database and run simultaneously in a compatibility mode.

It is only possible to encrypt a document with ELO functions when it is filed to the ELO repository.

Documents in the Intray are always stored in unencrypted format until they are moved to the

repository. ELO functions are not designed to encrypt documents already in ELO, because as soon

as documents are filed to the repository, the documents may be distributed in unencrypted form to

a backup path, revision-controlled media, and various backup systems.

Encryption can only be configured by users with the Main administrator right. A user who knows the

encryption key and the corresponding password is able to implement encryption. An encryption key

is therefore not necessarily bound to a single person – it can also be used for groups.

Documents encrypted with AES-256 can be added to the full text database. To do this, you need to

create a system user that can access the encrypted documents. You can, but do not have to, add

encrypted documents to the full text database.

The encryption keys are not to be confused with the keys concept that was discontinued starting

with version 10.

You will find more information on encryption under Configuration and administration > System

administration > Folders and documents > Encryption keys.

Permissions in ELO

Introduction 

In ELO, it is possible to assign permissions to individual entries and objects to further refine the

settings for user access to system information.

This includes the following permissions:

R (Read)

W (Write)

D (Delete)

E (Edit)

L (List)

P (Permissions)

Assigning these permissions prevents unauthorized parties from accessing information.

Margin notes 

There are three different types of margin notes.

General margin note 

General margin notes can be created, edited, or deleted by every user that can view the entry. If

the user only has the Read right to the document, they can only delete general margin notes that

they have created themselves.

Personal margin note 

Users that have read access to the entry can create, edit, or delete these types of margin notes. No

other users can see these margin notes.

Permanent margin note 

Any user who can view the entry can also see the permanent margin notes attached to it but

cannot alter or delete them.

45 Configuration and administration



Annotations 

There are annotations with and without text.

Annotations with text include sticky notes, text notes, and stamps. Annotations without text

include freehand marker, rectangle marker, horizontal marker and strikethrough, the redaction tool,

and image stamps.

Permission Name Permission

R (Read) View (R) View annotations on a document

Stamps 

In this section, we will look at stamps as a tool and their function as an applied stamp.

'Stamps' tool 

Stamps are defined for a specific user, option group, or globally using ProfileOpts. This sets the

defined stamp in the list of available stamps for the corresponding users. If there are no stamps

available to the user (either user-specific or group stamps), this user cannot use the stamps tool.

The user is also unable to create their own stamps in the ELO Java Client.

You can only set the permissions for metadata forms in the ELO Administration Console.

Permission Name Permission

R (Read)

File entries and enter metadata (also when filing initial version). If

you do not have the W right for the metadata form, you cannot

change the metadata of the entries. Even if you have the W right for

the entry, the dialog box opens in read-only mode. To change the

metadata of an entry filed with the form, you need the W right to the

entry as well.

D (Delete)
Delete form

This right was checked in the ELO Windows Client and still exists for

historical reasons. Currently, it is not checked. The Main administrator

right is checked to be able to delete metadata forms in the ELO

Administration Console.

Fields 

In the Display mode field settings, you need to define whether you want to be able to enter data

manually (Normal access), or whether you want the index fields to be read-only (Read-only), or

whether you want them to be hidden from view (Hidden).

This is a parent property. You can set more detailed permissions for normal access at the

permissions level.

Workflows 

Starting with ELO 11, you can set access rights to individual workflows as a process. When

designing a workflow template, if you do not want to assign any permissions, the default setting

for workflow access up to ELO 10 applies: Users with the right View workflows for all users can see

the workflow (R right). Users with the right Manage workflows can see, change, permanently

remove, and end the workflow (R W D E rights). The L right does not have any effect on workflows.

If there are no permissions configured for a workflow, the system behaves as follows:

Users with the right Manage workflows (FLAG_EDITWF) are assigned R W D E L

Users with the right View workflows for all users (FLAG2_WF_CONTROLLER) are assigned R

The following is checked with permissions:

View workflow (R) requires either the View (R) access right or the View workflows for all

users (FLAG2_WF_CONTROLLER) user right, or the user must be entered to an active

workflow node.

Edit workflow (W) requires the Write (W) and Manage workflows (FLAG_EDITWF) access

rights.

Delete workflow (D) requires the Delete (D) and Manage workflows (FLAG_EDITWF) access

rights.

End workflow (E) requires the Edit and Manage workflows (FLAG_EDITWF) access rights.

ELO Spaces 

The permissions for the contents of teamspaces and workspaces in ELO are determined based on

the assigned roles.

You can assign the following default permissions for contents in teamspaces and workspaces to a

role:

Permission Name Permission

R (Read) View (R) View entry

W (Write)

folder, move or remove documents from the folder

P

The current permissions only take effect if the user has the corresponding user rights.

You can also set authorization options for entries that were created in a teamspace or workspace.

For more information, refer to the ELO Java Client documentation.

Other permissions 

For historical reasons, the following uses both the terms parent rights and owner rights, though

these are also permissions.

Parent rights 

The parent rights are the permissions that are inherited from an element. Child entries in a folder

can either be folders or documents. Child entries in a document can either be attachments or notes.

Example: The permissions to a document only apply for a group and Everyone has permissions to

the notes in the document. In this case, the rights to the document take precedence, so not 

Everyone will be able to see the note, but only those who also have read permission to the

document.

If a user has permissions to a document but does not have permissions to the document filing path,

the document will show up in the results list following a search query or if a link is created.

Owner Owner rights 

The owner rights are a placeholder for the user that

creates a folder

filed a document

places a stamp or any other annotation on a document.

started a workflow

Everyone 

Ideally, there should be very few entries in the ELO repository that Everyone has full access to.

You can check whether your repository contains such an object by having your administrator set up

a dynamic folder in which all objects are displayed that permit full access to the Everyone group.

To do so, create a folder with the following line on the Extra text tab:

Please note

The Everyone group needs read permissions to personal folders so that services can access

them. If read permission for Everyone is removed, other users can no longer see the profile

page of this user, for example.

Concept for assigning rights and

permissions

Introduction 

The following concept for assigning rights and permissions is merely a recommendation.

The ability to assign rights to individual users and/or groups is a standard feature of ELO. In

addition to this standard feature, users can also assign permissions to folders and documents. The

objective is to assign users as many permissions as necessary but as few as possible to give them

access to documents and data.

You can assign rights at the user level but in most cases, this is not very effective. It makes more

sense to organize users with the same rights into groups and to assign permissions based on these

groups. The users are then assigned to these groups.

This document presents a logical structure for the permissions groups. The intention is to keep the

structure as simple as possible so that it can be implemented in ELO without any problems.

The permissions in the ELO repository should correspond to the tasks of the users in the company.

The following should be taken into consideration:

What tasks do the employees have within the company?

In what departments do the employees work?

What information and documents do the employees need to complete their tasks within the

company?

•

• 

54 Configuration and administration



Assigning user rights 

In response to the first question of what tasks the employee has in the company, we can assign

user rights. Depending on what the data and documents in the ELO repository will be used for, you

can assign user rights via different groups. In our example of a rights concept, we distinguish

between five different groups of user rights.

ELO view users 

These users may "only" view folders and documents, apply annotations and notes, or write feed

posts. They cannot make changes to the metadata, edit, or change the document in any way. These

users can perform searches in the repository but do not enter content or file items themselves.

55 Configuration and administration



The role group ELO_ViewUsers (minimal rights) can have the following right:

Change password

ELO standard users 

ELO standard users have extended rights permitting them to edit documents and metadata.

Depending on their rights, these users can change or delete documents and folders, change, print,

and export metadata, and start and edit workflows.

• 

56 Configuration and administration



Typical tasks for these users are to file new documents to the ELO repository and/or to edit them.

The role group ELO_StandardUsers (basic rights for editing documents) can have the following

rights:

ELO Desktop Client Plus user

Edit documents

Delete documents

Start workflows

Extend workflow rights

• 

• 

• 

57 Configuration and administration



ELO power users 

These users are authorized to do more technical and administrative tasks in ELO. Typically, they

edit the folder structure in ELO and its permissions concept. They implement the repository

structure with static or dynamic folders, or with default indexes that can be used by other users.

They can edit documents as well as document options or change the expiration date and document

status. They can delete non-modifiable documents and versions. They can check the status of

workflows they are not involved in.

58 Configuration and administration



The role group ELO_PowerUsers (extended rights including editing the folder structure) can have

the following rights:

Edit folders

Delete folders

Edit permissions

Edit keyword lists

Edit retention period

Author for approval documents

Delete versions

View all workflows from all users (check)

Delete non-modifiable documents

Change document editing status

ELO area administrators 

These users can manage repository settings for the users they administer as well as their

substitutes. They act as administrators for their own departments, are familiar with internal

processes, and create the required workflow templates. They know what data has to be entered

when filing documents and define the required metadata forms and keyword lists. They can create

stamps and edit font colors.

ELO area administrators are not responsible for editing and working with documents, but for

structure, processes, and keeping the repository in order. They also perform monitoring tasks.

user data for all other users. They can manage organizational units, assign replication sets, remove

locks, manage and move document files in the document system, back them up, or delete them

permanently.

ELO administrators do not work with folders or documents in the repository, but instead generally

perform administrative tasks only.

61 Configuration and administration



62 Configuration and administration



Groups and permissions concept 

It makes sense to combine functions and permissions into groups.

To assign different areas in the repository different permissions, we recommend creating specific

area groups. The example below illustrates how you can assign rights via groups and AND groups.

Assigning rights via groups 

Company XYZ has HR, Production, and Logistics departments. The repository provides different

permissions that can be assigned to the different departments.

Membership in the different departments also controls permissions to the documents in the

repository. In our example, users from the HR department can access all documents in the HR area,

while users from production have access to the Production area and users from logistics have

access to the Logistics area. The user groups are created according to the company departments

for this reason.

The groups assigned via user rights, also referred to as role groups, are combined with the groups

corresponding to department membership.

User rights should always be linked to groups and not to individual users. This allows you to track,

monitor, and manage assigned rights.

The role group or ELO_StandardUsers user rights group in our company has the following

employees:

The HR department has the following employees. They are granted exclusive access to documents

in the HR area.

63 Configuration and administration



AND groups 

The following figure illustrates a scenario for assigning permissions within the HR department.

Now, we can set permissions to documents and folders in the HR area using an AND group:

Members of both the HR and ELO_StandardUsers groups have permissions.

This allows you to give all HR employees view permissions to documents from the HR department,

for example.

64 Configuration and administration



To ensure that only the ELO_StandardUsers in the HR group are given full access to these

documents, we will create an AND group. An AND group contains the overlap from the selected

groups.

65 Configuration and administration



In this example, the members of the AND group have full access to this document. ELO shows what

employees are members of this group in the example.

66 Configuration and administration



Assigning permissions via metadata forms 

To ensure that the HR documents can only be edited by authorized users, we recommend defining

permissions using the metadata form and not for individual entries in the repository.

LDAP

Introduction 

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables you to import users and groups from an

Active Directory (AD) into the ELO system. This is done with LDAP import.

You need to set up and configure the connection between LDAP and the ELO LDAP interface for the 

LDAP import to work.

In addition, LDAP authentication must be enabled to allow users to log on to ELO with the data

stored in the Active Directory.

You will find the menu items in the ELO Administration Console under LDAP.

The user administration in the LDAP directory is managed in a tree structure. In this concept, a

unique name within the LDAP directory, known as the distinguished name (DN), is used as a unique

key for each user. An example of a DN is cn=John Smith,ou=people,dc=comy,dc=org. The DN in this

case is composed of three parts: the common name (CN), the organizational unit (OU), and the 

domain component (DC). The combination of OU/DC is used to reference different branches within the

LDAP tree structure. The DC addresses the top level below the LDAP directory root node. This

usually represents the Internet domain of the company. The schema data is also located directly

under the root node. The possible attributes are already specified in the LDAP schema, and the

corresponding values for these properties are saved in the LDAP entry that is resolved through the

DN.

Please note

Do not use a ; (semicolon) in group and user names in the Active Directory.

69 Configuration and administration



LDAP interface configuration 

The menu item LDAP interface configuration in the ELO Administration Console is where you edit

the connection settings, user import settings, and attribute assignment settings of the configuration

file ldap.json. The file ldap.json is stored in the repository under the following path:

Administration//IndexServer Scripting Base//_ALL//ldap.json

Information

Path changes are possible in the following cases:

If you want to make a special configuration for an ELO Indexserver, copy the file to the

directory of the respective ELO Indexserver and make changes to the file there.

If you'd like to make different configurations for different ELO Indexservers, you will

need a separate file for each ELO Indexserver.

The configuration only applies to a single repository. If you edit the configuration in the ELO

Administration Console, you need to restart the ELO Indexserver of the repository. If there are

multiple ELO Indexservers, you need to restart all of them.

Please note

You should not use LDAP to authenticate the ELO Service account (or the service account

used). This allows the server-side ELO applications to run independently of the LDAP

configuration. Disabling the LDAP connection can cause the ELO applications to no longer

start. In this case, you will not be able to enable the LDAP connection in the ELO

Administration Console.

Administrator accounts should not be authenticated via LDAP either.

You can make settings for multiple domains.

• 

• 

70 Configuration and administration



Under Domain selection, you see a list of available domains.

Add (green plus icon): Add settings for a domain

Delete (red X icon): Delete the settings of a domain

Reload data from server (yellow circle arrow icon): Reload the Domain selection area

Information

In case of connection problems, the ELO Indexserver log file can be set to debug. This makes

troubleshooting easier.

Connection settings 

Domain name: Specify the DNS name or IP address of the domain here. The setting is used if the 

userPrincipalName is derived from the sAMAccountName.

LDAP URL The entries in the LDAP URL field determine the TCP connection to the LDAP server.

LDAP authentication account: SSO requires a technical account to search LDAP for the user name

transferred by the SSO mechanism (usually sAMAccountName). Enter a userPrincipalName.

Please note

The account must have sufficient rights to read the user attributes and group memberships.

71 Configuration and administration



Please note

When using Kerberos: Disconnect the Kerberos account and the LDAP authentication

account. The Kerberos account does not have to be created in ELO.

LDAP password: In the LDAP password field, you can enter the unencrypted password of the LDAP

authentication account. The ELO Indexserver stores the password encrypted on restart.

Connection timeout in seconds: The LDAP interface terminates the connection to the LDAP server

after this number of seconds. It then attempts to establish a connection with the next server in the

list.

Search timeout in seconds: When searching for users or groups, this timeout value is passed to the

LDAP server.

User import 

72 Configuration and administration



DN for person search: Use this field to specify which branches of the LDAP directory to search for

users.

Please note

The list must not be empty.

Don't enter too many branches either. The more branches, the more imprecise the search.

Search filter for persons: You can use this filter to restrict the search for users.

Search filter for e-mails: The first time the user authenticates with an e-mail address, this filter is

used to search for the user in the LDAP directory.

Required group membership: With this setting, you can use the common name to restrict

authentication to users who are members of a certain group in the LDAP directory.

DN for group search: In this field, you specify which branches of the LDAP directory the groups that

are eligible for synchronization must be in. If the list is empty, all groups of the user are included in

group synchronization.

Search filter for groups: You can use this filter to restrict the search for groups of a user.

Maximum nesting depth: This field can be used to specify the depth of group nesting. This refers to

the collection of user groups for group synchronization.

73 Configuration and administration



Attribute assignment 

Domain prefix: The domain prefix is required if multiple domains are configured and the 

sAMAccountName is saved as the Windows attribute for the ELO user.

There must be a separator at the end of the domain prefix. This separates the prefix from the user

name. Ideally, you should use a backslash.

Information

If you are using SSO, the domain prefix must match the NetBIOS domain name.

You will find the corresponding domain prefix for SSO in the USERDOMAIN environment variable on the

client computer. For SSO with domain prefix, you need to set the option "ntlm.domainUserFormat"

in the ELO Indexserver config.xml file. If you set the option sAMAccountName in the User

authentication via field and specify a domain prefix, the Windows user contains the account name

with the domain prefix in front.

Example:

sAMAccountName = fritzfrei

Domain prefix = ELO\

Windows user = ELO\fritzfrei

• 

• 

• 

74 Configuration and administration



Placeholder for ELO user names: The ELO user name can be made up of different LDAP user

attributes. You can specify a format expression with placeholders. Enclose the placeholders in $

signs. They must also correspond to the LDAP attribute names.

User authentication via: In the drop-down menu User authentication via, you can specify whether

you want to set the sAMAccountName, the userPrincipalName, or the UID as the Windows user attribute

(see ELO user manager).

Please note

The setting selected in the User authentication via field must match the settings in the 

Search filter for persons field (User import tab). Pay attention to capitalization.

Any umlauts should also be identical between the Active Directory and ELO user names.

The ELO Administration Console checks LDAP for the following four attributes. The ELO

Administration Console uses the first attribute set for the name.

Information

Some environments require a custom configuration. This field enables you to enter any

values.

Supervisor attribute name: In this field, you specify which attribute is used to determine the

supervisor of the ELO user. This is usually the attribute $manager$.

Please note

The supervisor must already exist in ELO.

ELO administrator of this user: In the field ELO administrator of this user, you can specify which ELO

user to set as administrator for users created via the LDAP interface. You can enter the ID, GUID, or

ELO user name.

Save attributes in ELO: In this field, you specify which attributes are to be transferred from LDAP to

ELO.

To add an attribute, enter the name of the attribute in the field. Next, click Add ( green plus icon).

To remove an attribute, click the X icon next to it in the list of attributes.

LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.DISPLAY_NAME,

LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.CN,

LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.SAM_ACCOUNT_NAME

LdapServerFactory.CONST.USERINFO.DISTINGUISHED_NAME

LDAP import 

With LDAP import, you can import users and groups from an Active Directory (AD) into the ELO

system.

Select server: The ELO Administration Console attempts to find possible LDAP servers

automatically. If this field is blank, no server will be found in the domain. This may be the

case with a VPN connection, for instance.

Server: Enter the server for the LDAP connection here. You can also enter the IP address, port,

or protocol here.

BNF: server ::=[ldap|ldaps]://[servername|IP address]:port

• 

• 

77 Configuration and administration



Please note

Use an encrypted connection, in this case LDAP via SSL (LDAPS).

Domain user and password: The authentication data consists of a name and password.

Ignore certificate validation: The certificate validation can be ignored if needed.

Base DN and LDAP organizational unit: These entries are used to select the correct branch of

the LDAP directory.

Filter templates and filter text: Some LDAP filter expressions are already provided in the list

and applied to the filter text so that they can be edited.

Mapping script: This setting allows you to edit the data as JavaScript code.

For more information, see the next section The mapping script.

Reset mapping: Deletes the text from the mapping script field.

Update existing users or groups: If the name can be resolved to an existing entry, this entry

is only processed again if this setting is enabled.

Please note

LDAP groups are only read and used when users log on.

Create groups in ELO that exist in LDAP: Creates groups that do not yet exist in ELO.

Start search: Performs a search and shows the results.

Results list: Shows the list of the entries that will be imported. All valid entries are also

selected. If invalid data is detected during the check, they will not be selected, and a note

about the problem is shown in a tooltip.

The mapping script 

Default LDAP attributes are automatically mapped to ELO attributes. To allow more flexible

customization, JavaScript code can be entered in the input field. This is embedded in a code frame

and is performed on every data set in the LDAP search.

The ELO Indexserver has a data structure for the users and groups: the UserInfo object. This is

described in detail in the ELO Indexserver technical documentation. It can be accessed in the

mapping script using the variable name elo.

Default mapping 

elo.type 

Based on the LDAP ObjectClass=person

If the class exists, a user is created; otherwise a group is created.

78 Configuration and administration



elo.name 

Based on the LDAP attributes displayName, cn, sAMAccountName, and distinguishedName.

The first LDAP attribute found is used as the name.

elo.userProps[UserInfoC.PROP_NAME_OS] 

The value of the sAMAccountName LDAP attribute is applied.

elo.userProps[UserInfoC.PROP_NAME_EMAIL] 

The value of the LDAP attribute mail is applied.

elo.superiorId 

The LDAP attribute manager is evaluated.

If the manager attribute refers to an existing ELO user, the ID of this user is applied as the

supervisor.

elo.id 

If the name refers to a valid ELO user, this ID is applied as the user ID. Otherwise -1

creates a new user.

JavaScript code frame 

At the debug log level, the generated script is output to the log file.

If the ELO Administration Console is started using Java 8, the Rhino compatibility mode is included.

The JavaScript frame is accessed via the LdapImportMapping Java interface. In the map, the ELO

name in lowercase is used as the key to the UserName object.

Examples 

A data set can be excluded by setting elo.id=0.

Since JavaScript code can be used, it is also possible to view outputs for testing using the

error reporting mechanism.

or also

A short example shows how to exclude items while checking the mail attribute and set the

display name for the remaining users.

• 

if (elo.name.startsWith('_')){

elo.id=0

}

• 

throw ldap.get('mail').getClass()

throw userNames['administrator'].id

• 

var emailRegex = /^[\w._-]+[+]?[\w._-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/

var lMail = ldap.get('mail')

if (lMail){

    lMail = lMail.get()

    if(emailRegex.test(lMail)){

        elo.name += ' ('+lMail.split('@').pop()+')'

        // valid e-mail -> customize the display name.

    }

}else{

    elo.id=0

    // invalid e-mail -> exclude

}

80 Configuration and administration



Enable LDAP authentication 

LDAP authentication is disabled/LDAP authentication is enabled: Use this toggle to enable or

disable LDAP authentication.

Create new users automatically: If the option Create new users automatically is enabled, a new

user is automatically created in ELO after logon.

Information

Initial authentication, i.e. the user does not exist in ELO yet, must take place with one of the

following values:

sAMAccountName, userPrincipalName, or mail for Active Directory

UID or mail for OpenLDAP

Assign group: If the Assign group option is enabled, users are automatically assigned to the

corresponding LDAP groups. For this to work, the groups must be created in ELO and the names

must match the names of the groups in LDAP.

Please note

LDAP groups are only read and used when users log on.

81 Configuration and administration



ELO user for internal authentication: In this field, you can specify which ELO users/groups should not

authenticate with LDAP. These users/groups can log on to ELO directly.
