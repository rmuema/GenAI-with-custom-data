ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to install and configure ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor

from ELO Digital Office GmbH.

This implementation has been tested for the following ELO versions:

ELOprofessional and ELOenterprise version 11.01.000 and higher

ELO DocXtractor 5 SP01 and higher

The ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor interface enables you to provide changed or new data in

the ERP system (such as order data) to ELO DocXtractor immediately. This makes the planning of

jobs for reading data in the ERP system as well as interval-controlled updates of the entire

database obsolete. The data in the matching server as well as the ELO DocXtractor database are

current on runtime.

Configuration 

Configuring ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor 

To see the configuration entries for ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor, the Configurator first has

to reinitialize the subsystem (from a technical point of view, it has to reload the 

specialConfigsERPDatatransfer.xml file). You can either restart the Configurator or switch to another

subsystem and back.

In the Configurator, navigate to the configuration settings for your subsystem. Later, this will

be represented by Invoice.

Within the ELO\ERP Datatransfer configuration entry, set the parameter described below.

Host 

Enter the server IP address or FQDN the web service for ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor

should run on here. Generally, this is the address of the server ELO DocXtractor is installed on.

OpenJDKPath 

This configuration entry must contain the OpenJDK directory, e.g. %SF_ROOT_DIR%\System\Etc\jdk-15.

Information

This entry will likely no longer be necessary as soon as ERP Datatransfer for ELO

DocXtractor becomes a smartblock.

Password 

Create a password here that the ERP system will then use to authenticate with the ERP

Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor interface.

1. 

2. 

10 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Port 

The port for the ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor web service.

Information

You may have to enable ports in the network explicitly. If you have connection problems,

contact your network administrator. This port is self-defined; do not confuse it with the port

of the added ELO DocXtractor component.

PrimaryKeyColumns 

This configuration entry is required if ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor has to generate a

primary key for the data sets before making an entry to the ELO DocXtractor matching data.

Enter the table name and the column in the following convention: Table|Column. For additional

tables and columns, use a semicolon as a separator. If an entry is specified for a table, a new data

set is inserted in the specified column of the value max+1 during the Insert action.

Example: Invoice 

With a standard ELO DocXtractor Invoice installation, a combination of company code and vendor

represent the unique key for the vendor. If you want to provide all bank accounts per vendor to ELO

DocXtractor, this would result in a primary key violation. To be able to save all bank accounts, we

add the column VEPK to the SFIVENDOR* table in this case. This additional column is also added to

the Unique Index of the table and the matching server configuration. As the values for this column

don't come from the ERP system, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor generates a unique key.*

The value for the configuration entry for the case above would then be: SFI_VENDOR|VE_PK.

Information

You also need to consider the settings in DocXtractor: Make the VE_PK column known as the

primary key to the MatchingServer in the DocXtractor Document Manager.

ReloadTables 

In this configuration entry, you can define which tables or views the matching server should reload

when changes are made to data in a specific table. The value of the configuration entry is a list of

values separated by semicolons.

For the Invoice case in which order data requires a reload of the order view after changes to item

data, the value looks like this:

<Table>|<Table or View 1>¶<Table or View 2>¶...<Table or View n>

11 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



SaveDataDir (optional) 

If this configuration entry has been set, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor saves the data

transferred from the ERP system for debugging in the directory specified in the configuration entry.

Separator 

The defined column separator the data is transferred with.

User 

This user name is used for authentication between the ERP system (e.g. an SAP system) and the

ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor interface.

Information

The user does not have to be a system-specific ERP user. However, the user has to be

entered in the ERP system configuration for authentication/connection. You will find this

configuration taking connecting to an SAP system as an example in the section Installation

and configuration: Configuring a destination.

WriteLogFile 

Specifies whether a log file should be written per import when importing data.

Please note

Writing log files results in significant decreases in performance. We recommend only writing

logs if there is a specific reason to do so.

Updating the system 

Once you have set up ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor as described above, you have to 

refresh the clients and refresh the subsystem in the Coordinator. ERP Datatransfer for ELO

DocXtractor will then be visible in the Coordinator as follows.

SFI_ORDER_ITEM|SFI_ORDER

Available functions 

ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor requires basic authentication with user and password for all

calls.

\status 

The ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor status page can be queried with http_get.

\lastError 

The last error including date and time can be queried with http_get.

\insert 

The data sets can be entered to the matching database via the matching server with http_post.

Example http_post body:

-----------------------------9051914041544843365972754266

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uplfile"; filename="uplfile.txt"

\insertDB 

The body of http_post has an identical structure to that of \insert. The difference is that the data

isn't transferred to the database via the matching server, but directly via ODBC. After Insert, the

data is loaded to the matching server database.

\update 

The data sets sent with http_post update the data in the matching server and matching database.

Example http_post body:

\delete 

The data sets sent with http_post are removed from the matching server and the matching

database.

Modification of table SFI_VENDOR with complete data sets (that is, including bank data, tax

information, telephone and fax number, e-mail)

When inserting new data sets with \insert, the data sets transferred with http_post can be entered

to the matching database via the matching server. The advantage of this is that the data is

available to the ELO DocXtractor system right away without reloading. However, each time a data

set is inserted, the matching server index is optimized. As a result, you can only insert approx. 10

data sets per second. This is especially important to remember when initially filling the matching

database.

Besides \insert, ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor also provides an \insertDB function. As the

data is written directly to the database, the matching server index does not have to be optimized

after every Insert. Measurements have shown that you can insert approximately 350-400 data sets

per second in the matching database in this way.

We therefore do not recommend transferring more than

2,000 data sets per \insert call (corresponding to approx. 3-4 minutes) and

100,000 data sets per \insertDB call (corresponding to approx. 3-4 minutes).

In any case, the values should be adapted to the actual performance of the specific system.

Please note

If you use an ELO DocXtractor version lower than 5.0 SP01, do not submit more than 100,000

data sets per call. This kind of call would very likely fail and cause a communication error in

SAP. Use the filter function or an Insert per company code.

In both cases, make sure that the web service call does not result in a timeout when the call is

performed within the ERP system.

Note regarding the SFI_ORDER_ITEM table 

The performance difference between \insert and \insertDB isn't as significant with the 

SFI_ORDER_ITEM table. The \insert function is much faster, as no key columns are defined for the

table in the matching server, making entries to the matching server easier.

SAP Netweaver® und SAP S/4HANA®

SAP NetWeaver® and SAP S/4HANA®

This chapter explains how to connect ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor to SAP NetWeaver®

and SAP S/4HANA® systems.

Information

Using ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor requires outgoing HTTP communication

capabilities. You can check this within the SAP system in the SMICM transaction under Goto –

Parameters – Display and then under icm/server_port. http protocol must contain an entry.

The SAP system must also be able to reach the ELO server and the ELO DocXtractor system.

Process description 

To supply ELO DocXtractor with the required data, such as order data or vendor data, a trigger is

required within the SAP system to initiate data transmission to ELO DocXtractor. Within SAP, you

can use the event linkage function for this. For example, changing or creating orders within the SAP

system results in a triggering event, which you can use as a starting point for programs. If you

change and save an order, the CHANGED event results in the new data set being sent to ERP

Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor.

This documentation covers the following topics and more:

Installation and configuration 

SAP transport 

You will find all the required programs and functions in the SAP transport provided on the ELO

SupportWeb. Inform your customer or the SAP partner about the SAP transport to be installed and

provide it to them.

Information

Inform your customers or SAP partner of the following:

The standard SAP transport routes must be used.

All developments and functions within the transport in ELO were developed in a

separate SAP namespace, called /ELO/.

You may have to enable the Ignore Invalid Component Version option when importing the

SAP transport.

It is also possible that you will encounter warnings when importing the transport due to

different release statuses (return code 8), which can be ignored.

Once the SAP transport has been imported successfully into the SAP system, the other required

steps can be performed.

Check workflow customizing 

You need to check that the workflow customizing is correctly configured.

If a customizing has not been entered for the menu item Configure RFC Destination, you need

to configure this first

Fig.: Transaction SWU3 – Check background user

If you click the icon highlighted here or press F7, you can find out which user has been

entered for the workflow destination.

Configuring permissions 

The events in SAP are carried out by the WF-BATCH user as standard. If this user does not have full

access, for example via the profile SAP_ALL, a role with the following rights has to be set up and

assigned to the event user:

Permissions for event user

Permissions object Field name Value

S_RFC RFC_TYPE FUGR

S_RFC RFC_NAME /ELO/DOCX

S_RFC ACTVT 16

If you want to transfer all values from the SAP system to ELO DocXtractor initially with a user, this

user will need rights to execute the /ELO/DOCX_SETTINGS transaction.

The data provider is responsible for data retrieval and can initially be populated with the

configuration for the default values. Make sure to manually set the destination name depending on

the destination you configured.

Example: Changing a purchase order (BUS2012)

The class /ELO/CL_DOCX_GET_ORDERS is applied in the CHANGED event in the SAP business

object BUS2012 for data determination. Access takes place via the DOCX_CONNECT destination

and the data is sent to ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor. The interface enters the data in

the matching server and matching database.

The data provider configuration also allows you to customize data retrieval for your customer-

specific requirements.

Header definitions 

Fig.: Configuring the header definitions

By configuring header definitions, you can configure the mapping between fields determined from

the data and fields from the ELO DocXtractor table. The table definition is structured as follows:

Type: Defines the type that the field matching belongs to. Type O (orders), V (vendors), and P

(partners) fields are available as standard.

Sort order: By entering a numeric sequence, you can define the order that the columns of the

table should be output in. This allows you to control the order in which the columns in the

ALV grid (ALV = SAP List Viewer) are shown in the Transfer data option. This setting does not

affect database population and is only intended for better visualization.

ELO DocXtractor field name: In this table column, enter the field name of the ELO DocXtractor

table you want to transfer the component contents to.

Component: Enter the component field name in these fields. In this case, the component is a

separate table that contains the determined data from the SAP system. You will find more

information about field mapping in the section Source of SAP data: Vendor data.

Filter: This flag is used for updates and as a filter. For example, you can set the columns for

Transfer data 

Fig.: Configuration – Transfer data

With the Transfer data function, you can display the determined data applying the set selection

criteria and transfer it to a destination. This function can help you perform tests when configuring

ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor.

You also have the option to initially populate the matching server and the matching database with

order and vendor information with this function. See the Initial startup chapter for more details.

The following configurations are available:

Data provider: Select which data the data provider should determine and send to the defined

destination. You can choose order data, vendor data, or your own class. If you use your own class,

you have to maintain it. The section Installation and configuration: Data provider per BO describes

how to maintain custom classes.

Data selection: With the All entries parameter, you can display or transmit the result unfiltered.

This is similar to a selection on the database with *. However, if you select Restrict to object ID, the

selection is restricted to this input. The ObjectID always depends on the SAP business object. This

27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



means that you select the vendor number (lfa1-lifnr) for SAP business object LFA1 and the

document number/order number (ekbe-ebeln) for SAP business object BUS2012.

Information

Initial population of the matching server and matching database with all the data from the

SAP system may take several minutes. If a communication error is returned, the connection

may have timed out. This does not mean that data transfer has failed. In the ELO

DocXtractor logs, check whether all data has been transferred properly. The communication

error message can be avoided in this case by increasing the destination timeout. You will

find all the necessary information in the section Installation and configuration: Configuring a

destination. Another option for populating the database is using the InsertDB transmission

type.

Transmission type: Five options are available. In every case, the first step results in data being

displayed in an ALV grid within the SAP system. In this grid, data is selected and the corresponding

command is run on the selection.

Do not transfer, only show: All data is displayed with the set selection criteria. No additional

steps are possible.

Update: Selected entries are updated in the matching server and matching database. An

update results in all entries for the vendor or order being deleted and entered again.

Delete: All selected entries are deleted in the matching server and matching database.

Insert (small data volumes): Enters all selected data sets in the matching database via the

matching server. This variant is used to transfer small data volumes, as the matching server

index is optimized each time a data set is inserted. Refer to the section ERP Datatransfer for

ELO DocXtractor: performance for more information.

InsertDB (large data volumes): The selected data sets are entered directly to the matching

database. The matching server index is then optimized. Refer to the section ERP Datatransfer

for ELO DocXtractor: performance for more information.

Queue entries

All transfers with errors or unsuccessful transfers that SAP has sent to ERP Datatransfer for ELO

DocXtractor are listed in an ALV grid.

Administration 

Fig.: Configuration – Administration – Reset tables

In the administration area, you can reset the tables to their original state on delivery and enable or

disable business partner logic. After enabling business partner logic, the logic in the Transfer data

area (see Installation and configuration: Transfer data) can be selected in the data provider. This is

called Vendor data (BP).

Please note

Resetting the tables deletes all custom settings for ERP Datatransfer for ELO DocXtractor

within the SAP configuration. If you change the business partner logic, we recommend

resetting the tables after. The header definitions are then completed for the changed logic.

Information 

The Information area contains copyright information and the product version. If you submit a

support case, always name the product version.

Set up events 

Events are needed for each changed or created vendor and each changed and created order. These

events forward the object ID of the changed/created object to the data providers set up in the

section Installation and configuration: Data provider per business object.

Add event linkage 

Adding event linkages requires permission to the SWETYPV transaction. All entries are added as

they are defined in the section Installation and configuration: Data provider per business object.

Fig.: Add event linkage

Click the New Entries function.

Please note

Fig.: Configuring a data provider per business object

The following steps have to be taken for each entry from the data provider per

business object. The same image as from the section Installation and configuration:

Data provider per business object applies here.

Receiver type: FM (function module)

Receiver call: Function module

Receiver function module (first): Two function modules are provided, /ELO/

DX_TRANSFER_CHANGE_EVENT and /ELO/DX_TRANSFER_CREATE_EVENT. Select the function

module from the event here. By default, this means that all events that are not called 

CREATED are assigned the function module /ELO/DX_TRANSFER_CHANGE_EVENT. CREATED

events are assigned the function module /ELO/DX_TRANSFER_CREATE_EVENT.

Event delivery: Using tRFC (default)

Receiver status: No errors

Click the icon to save or press CTRL+S.

Go a step back with the arrow icon or press the F3 key to add entries (as defined in the

section Installation and configuration: Data provider per business object).

Information

Depending on the SAP release version, configured events may not occur. In this case, the

configuration will not have any negative effects on your SAP system.

Enable event linkage for incoming goods 

To enable events resulting due to incoming goods, configure your SAP system based on Note 

1614466 on the SAP Support Portal. Check the SAP system for the steps named in the note.

Check change document events 

To check change document events, you will need access to the transaction SWEC. This transaction

is necessary as SAP systems do not trigger events when changing or adding vendors as standard.

This makes two entries necessary. Ideally, these entries will already exist thanks to the transport,

so check this first.

Fig.: Check whether events already exist

Information

Your SAP system may be configured to trigger an event more than once. A CHANGED type

event triggered multiple times causes the entry database to be updated multiple times,

which may possibly result in minor performance restrictions. But if a CREATED type event is

called multiple types, error messages will be written to the queue entries from the section 

Installation and configuration: Queue entries due to duplicates. If this is the case, check

which event is unnecessary and remove the relevant entry.

If these two entries already exist, you can skip the next steps.

Add change document events 

If neither of these entries exist, you will have to add them.

Initial startup 

The data transfer process is explained in the section Installation and configuration: Transfer data. If

using the system for the first time, data control via events only will not be enough. The matching

server database has to be populated with all data sets once.

Go to the Transfer data menu for this reason.

Under Data provider, select Order data.

Under Data selection, select All entries.

Use InsertDB as the transmission type and check the Clear DocX table box.

Click Run or press the F8 key.

Now, all data is gathered and displayed. Depending on the data volume, this can take several

minutes.

Fig.: Initial database population

Click the Select all button followed by the Transfer data button.

The transfer process can take much longer than the previous data determination process

within the SAP system. For more information about a possible timeout, refer to the section 

Installation and configuration: Configuring a destination.

SAP program for automatic sending of queue entries 

One part of the scope of delivery is the SAP program /ELO/DOCX_QUEUE. This program allows you

to re-send failed transfers within the queue entries of the administration area from the chapter 

Installation and configuration: Queue entries with a specified time. This program can also be

configured as a job in SAP.

The program has two transfer parameters.

Consider entries to: Enter a date from the past here. All queue entries from today to the

entered date are considered. If you leave the field blank, the program will consider all entries

up to seven days in the past.

Maximum failed attempts: This value determines how often a queue entry can fail during

transfer before it is skipped.
