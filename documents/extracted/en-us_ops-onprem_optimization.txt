ELO metadata tables

Getting started 

It can take a long time to search multiple metadata fields if the SQL Optimizer does not recognize

the strict search criteria in the query. It can help improve performance if you organize the field

values in a metadata table. Unlike the "objkeys" table, the field values are stored in the columns of

the database table instead of in the rows.

Information

This documentation applies to ELO 10 and higher.

This document describes how to improve searching multiple metadata fields by organizing the field

values as a metadata table.

3 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Problem 

It can take a long time to search multiple index fields in the Objkeys table if the SQL Optimizer

does not recognize the strict search criteria in the query.

In our use case, we perform searches using the bank code, account number, and a time range. The 

objkeys table contains 370 million rows. The search takes 1-3 seconds if the SQL Server has 48 GB

RAM. It takes 50 seconds if the server has 16 GB RAM. In Oracle Enterprise Manager, we can see

that the priority ranking of the search is the bank code followed by the time range and finally the

account number. This means that the Optimizer does not recognize that the search should first find

the account number, which is unique.

4 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Solution 

Instead of one row per index value and multiple rows per document when storing the field values to

the objkeys table, the field values are stored in a "flat" table with one column per field value and

one row per document. Performance tests based on the e-mail data in our live repository have

shown a five-fold increase in speed.

5 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Implementation 

New metadata form property: Data organization 

The metadata form uses the DocMask.dataOrganisation field to determine how field values should

be stored:

Data organization DB storage

DATA_ORGANISATION_OBJKEYS =

0;
Conventional storage as name-value pairs in the objkeys table

DATA_ORGANISATION_TABLE = 1;
Metadata table, one table for the metadata form (flat table), one

column per field.

Converting existing field data 

You can convert the field values of an existing metadata form into a metadata table using the

following code.

The index values are converted by setting the element

dataOrganisation = DocMaskC.DATA_ORGANISATION_TABLE

and then checking in the metadata form.

In a background job, the ELO Indexserver moves the data from the objkeys table to the metadata

table. The job status is listed under the GUID of the metadata form. It can be retrieved with 

queryJobState.

Information

It is not possible to convert fields with invalid group names, nor is it possible to

convert fields with duplicate group names.

Currently, it is not possible to convert a metadata table back into an objkeys table.

For fields with multiple field values (column index), only the first value is transferred

to the metadata table.

During the update, no changes should be made to the folder or document metadata

that are assigned metadata with the metadata form. However, you can create new

documents and folders.

The original file name is stored in the objkeys table (ELO_FNAME).

On startup, the Indexserver checks whether a conversion process was interrupted. If

this is the case, the Indexserver continues the conversion by evaluating an entry in

the eloixopt table with

Example 

Representation in the database 

The metadata table is created under the name "Keywording_" plus the metadata form ID. The fields

are represented as columns in the table.

Example 

IXID=_ALL,

OPTNAME=dataOrganisationTransfer_<maskid>,

OPTVALUE=<ixid>.

public static void changeDataOrganisation(IXConnection conn,

    String maskId) {

  log.info("start change data organisation");

  try {

    long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();

    DocMask dmTable = conn.ix().checkoutDocMask(maskId, DocMaskC.mbAll,

                                              LockC.NO);

    dmTable.setDataOrganisation(DocMaskC.DATA_ORGANISATION_TABLE);

    conn.ix();

    JobState jobState = conn.ix().queryJobState(dmTable.guid, true, true,

                                                   true);

    while (jobState.isJobRunning() {

      Thread.sleep(1000);

      jobState = conn.ix();

      log.info("jobState=" + jobState);

    }

    long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();

    log.info("end change data organisation, ms=" + (t2 - t1));

  } catch (Exception e) {

  log.error("Failed to convert data organisation", e);

  }

}

  [rechnr] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

Database indexes 

The Indexserver does not create database indexes on metadata tables. This is the sole

responsibility of the database administrator.

Case-insensitive search with Oracle 

To perform a case-insensitive search with Oracle, function-based indexes have to be used. Text

columns in the index are added as an UPPER function argument.

A suitable index could look as follows:

Editing the metadata form definition 

When you add a field in the ELO Administration Console, a column is added to the metadata table.

Please note

This column contains NULL values. Setting a default value for a field would take a very long

time for large tables. Existing objects are not assigned default values for this reason. They

only apply for new folders and documents.

Inversely, when you delete a field, the Indexserver removes the corresponding column from

the table.

All field data is lost.

  [liefernr] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [bestellnr] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [betreff] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [kdnr] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [lieferant] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [barcode] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [betrag] [nvarchar](255) NULL,

  [mitarb] [nvarchar](

)

CREATE INDEX "ARCHIV1"."IXKEYWORDING_32_01" ON "ARCHIV1"."KEYWORDING_32"

(

    UPPER(BANK),

   UPPER(KTO),

   PARENTID

)

TABLESPACE "TS_ELO_INDEX";

8 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Information

Like the metadata forms with objkeys data, metadata forms with metadata tables can only

be deleted if no more objects have this metadata.

When deleting a metadata form, if you specify an alternative one, the data is not converted

automatically.

MEtadata forms are not deleted permanently.

Searching metadata tables with "findfirstSords" 

The table to be searched is defined based on the metadata form specified in FindByIndex.

If no metadata form is specified in the search, the metadata forms are determined using the

field group names from the search query.

A search is run on the metadata tables that contain all the field groups specified in 

FindByIndex.objKeys.

If a metadata form with objkeys-based data contains all of the fields, the search is also

performed on the objkeys table.

If no metadata form contains all of the fields in the search, only objkeys is searched.

If metadata forms are specified in the FindByIndex, only these forms are searched. Enter the

forms to FindByIndex.maskId or the FindByIndex.maskIds array.

It is not currently possible to search all metadata table fields, nor is it possible to combine

fields in the search with an OR.

Effects on other ELO modules 

Indexserver client applications, ELO Java Client, ELO Web Client, etc. 

The field values from metadata tables are also returned or accepted in Sord.objKeys. Changes to

existing client applications are not necessary.

ELO Windows Client 

ELO is not planning to add metadata table functions to the ELO Windows Client. For this reason,

metadata tables can only be used in installations without the ELO Windows Client.

ELO Replication 

The ELO Replication module does not currently support metadata table synchronization.

10 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Restrictions 

Only one value per field possible (no column index)

During conversion, only the first value in a field is taken from the objkeys table

It is not possible to search all fields

(Re)conversion of metadata tables into the objkeys table not possible

OR-linked search not possible

During conversion, no information can be added to or edited in existing metadata form

entries

Only installations without the ELO Windows Client or ELO Replication
