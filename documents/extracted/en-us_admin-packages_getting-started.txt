2 ELO packages



Overview

The concept 

Packages allow you to create and edit related configurations. A package contains all the

configurations required for a purpose.

The levels concept allows you to manage and update customizations separately from the default

configuration.

ELO packages make it easier to transmit data from one system to another.

3 ELO packages



Metadata forms and aspects 

Metadata are an essential part of the packages. They are represented by metadata forms and

aspects.

Metadata forms allow you to classify ELO objects by different types. Metadata forms are the

framework that hold the aspects and fields together.

Metadata forms are made up of aspects. Aspects represent the basic properties of an object in ELO.

Aspects are divided into fields that contain the actual metadata and can link to other metadata

forms.

4 ELO packages



First steps 

To ensure that your packages are successfully implemented, it helps to consider certain things

before you start creating them.

The following steps provide a guide.

Define goals and usage context

What do you primarily want to map?

What is the package called?

What is the usage context of the package?

Transfer/deployment of an ELO Business Solution

Basic solution

Customer-side modifications

Basis for transferring ELO from the partner to the customer

Basis for staging transfer: development system, test system, production system

Should the package be made available in multiple languages?

Plan groups and permissions

Which people in the system are stakeholders in the package?

Who is allowed to/must access what?

Are there external stakeholders?

Which roles are in place?

Plan aspects and fields

Which aspects are required?

Which aspects are required in different contexts?

Which aspects are required multiple times in one metadata form?

Do the aspect views need to different depending on the context?

Which fields do the aspects require?

Which data types do the fields require?

Which keyword lists are required?

Plan metadata forms

In which metadata forms can you meaningfully group aspects?

Are there metadata forms that can be derived from other ones?

What dependencies with other metadata forms are there?

Which views for metadata forms are required?

6 ELO packages



Define goals and usage context 

Which data needs to be mapped depends largely on the requirements of the respective project and

should be discussed with the customer. You may find at this point that one package does not cover

the whole scenario.

Example: Student administration 

This documentation explains how to implement a system for student administration in ELO.

Information

Of course, the documentation cannot cover all aspects of student administration, so some

aspects are only addressed superficially.

The package in this example is intended to accomplish the following:

Enter students with different characteristics.

Assign students to faculties, departments, courses, and exams.

The usage context is the completely new development of a basic solution.

Since students from abroad can also enroll at the university, the solution should also be

localized into English.

Plan groups and permissions 

Depending on the project, different users are involved. Whether they are people from the same

team, the same company, or external stakeholders has a significant influence in terms of planning

the packages and the associated rights and permissions.

You also need to determine which roles are required so that you can plan the rights concept.

Example: Student administration 

In our example, the following groups of people can be identified:

Student administration 

Head: Has the role of Administrator. Can see, create, edit, and delete all objects.

Employees: Have the role of Employee. Can see, create, and edit all objects.

Teaching staff 

Dean: Has the role of Faculty management. Can see, create, edit, and delete all objects

belonging to their own faculty.

Lecturers: Have the role of Lecturer. Can see and edit all objects belonging to their own

faculty.

Students: Have the role of Student. Can only see and edit their own objects.

All persons are part of the system.

Based on this information, we can create the following groups:

Administrative management

Administrative staff

Faculty management

Lecturers

Students

You can learn how to create groups for a package under Groups.

You can configure additional steps when planning the spaces and the corresponding roles.

Plan aspects and fields 

The objectives, the usage context, and the users in the package already provide initial indications

of what the structure should be like.

Analyze which data the users need for their roles. This will enable you to define the aspects and

fields. You may also recognize possible dependencies with other data sets, and where there are

similar data sets.

Example: Student administration 

Administrative staff are the main users in the student administration system, but they focus

primarily on the students.

For example, the following are some of the aspects that could be defined for students:

Person

Addresses

Contact details

Faculty

Subjects

Courses

Semester

Status

Tickets

Fees

You can learn how to create these aspects in ELO under Metadata > Aspects > Create aspects.

Since aspects are composed of fields, the next step would be to plan the fields and their data types.

Here are some examples of possible aspects and fields:

Aspect Fields Type Occurrence

Person First name Text in general

Last name Text in general

Gender Selection list

Birthday Date

Nationality Selection list

Address Street Text in general

House number Text in general

Postal code Integer

City Text in general

Country Selection list

Phone Telephone number type Selection list Multiple times

9 ELO packages



Aspect Fields Type Occurrence

Phone number Integer

E-mail E-mail address type Selection list Multiple times

E-mail address E-mail address

Affiliation Faculty Relation Multiple times

Course Relation

Course Relation

…

You can use this kind of table to keep a record of the fields and field types you have defined.

However, the table is just one method to help you plan. You should use the method that best suits

your project.

To learn how to create fields and get more information on field types, see Metadata > Aspects >

Add fields.

The table shows that the Selection list type is suitable for many fields, for example, if the number

of possible entries must be limited, and/or the values are required for other automated processes.

You can learn how to create, edit, and manage keyword lists under Metadata > Keyword lists.

You can derive other important points from the student aspects. For example, information about

faculties, subjects, courses, and exams is essential. We recommend using relations for this. These

allow you to establish relationships with other data sets.

You can find more information about relations in the documentation Configuration and

administration > Metadata forms and fields > Create field templates > Field types and under 

Configuration and administration > Metadata forms and fields > Metadata forms > Use.

You may have already recognized that certain aspects are used in different contexts, and that

different views are required. Given that each aspect requires at least one view, the creation of

views is an important part of the planning process.

For more information on creating views, see Metadata > Aspects > Create view for aspect.

Plan metadata forms 

Metadata forms are used to group aspects and fields in a way that enables you to classify objects

in the ELO system. Once you have defined the aspects and fields, it is easy to create the metadata

forms.

We recommend that you conduct an analysis and record the results so that you can identify and

document possible dependencies between metadata forms and/or metadata forms and fields. This

makes it easier to plan which metadata forms are based on other information.

It also allows you to see which aspects need to be used multiple times in a metadata form.

Inheritance and relations are important concepts. Inheritance enables you to apply aspects to other

metadata forms so that you only have to create them once. With relations, you can map whole

data sets to fields in other metadata forms.

Depending on the user groups and roles as well as the different applications, you should also think

about what uses you will have for the metadata forms and which views you will need.

You will find more information on creating, editing, and managing metadata forms under Metadata

> Metadata forms.

Example: Student administration 

In our example, we can derive the following metadata forms based on the information collected:

Students

Faculties

Subjects

Classes 

Lab

Lecture

Seminar

Tutorial

…

You could create a simplified overview of the metadata form in tables in the following way:

The Course metadata form acts as a parent category for all courses. Multiple metadata forms (for

example Lab, Lecture, and Seminar) inherit all their settings from this metadata form.

12 ELO packages



These subtypes are used for new entries in the workspace. The Course metadata form can be used

for filters but is not used as a metadata form for entries.

Planning automation 

Where does automation make sense?

Which ELO modules can be used for automation?

During planning, you can consider which processes are common for the department/team and how

they can be simplified. ELO offers different options for automating processes, either completely or

in part.

ELO Flows: ELO Flows presents a new customization platform for ELO. It is intended to help

non-experts to create flows and offer ELO Business Partners a new platform for developing

custom modules for use in these flows. For more information, refer to Configuration and

administration > Processes and automation > ELO Flows

ELO workflows: ELO workflows can map complex company processes. For more information,

refer to Configuration and administration > Processes and automation > ELO workflows

ELO Automation Services: ELO Automation Services are used to automate tasks within ELO.

Rule sets are used for this purpose. For more information, refer to Configuration and

administration > Processes and automation > ELO Automation Services

Plan spaces 

Are spaces needed for entire teams?

Will the package be used for collaboration across teams?

Which data aggregations are required?

Which role needs which data?

ELO Teamspaces 

ELO Teamspaces is intended for collaboration in groups made up of different divisions,

departments, or teams.

In ELO Teamspaces, you can share information with members of the teamspace and edit it.

In our example, this could be a group that meets to plan classes and coordinate session dates and

rooms. Participants come from different faculties and departments.

To create and work with a teamspace, you will find more detailed information on the following

pages:

Create templates for ELO Teamspaces

Working with ELO Teamspaces in the ELO Java Client

Working with ELO Teamspaces in the ELO Web Client

ELO Workspaces 

A workspace is suitable as a work environment for a group of users working on the same topic.

All information for the work group is collected and processed in the workspace.
