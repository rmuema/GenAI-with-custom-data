Basics 

What is the ELO Desktop Client? 

As a sidebar, the ELO Desktop Client is always docked to your desktop and monitors the active

window. When it detects a supported application, the client becomes active. Depending on the

application, the ELO Desktop Client offers a wide range of ELO functions. It supports Microsoft

Office applications, Windows Explorer, and the Windows Desktop. You can dock the client on the

left or right side of the desktop.

Documents with a yellow arrow next to the document icon and a name are checked out by the

corresponding user. They can be viewed (Document > Open in read-only mode), but not edited.

Folders 

In the repository structure, your documents are created in folders. If you've selected a folder, you

can view the contents and the child folders in a separate window using the Preview function

(keyboard shortcut: spacebar).

You can change how the folder is displayed and the sort order (1), or browse the folder by short

name (2).

If you want to select multiple entries at once, you can only do this in the repository structure. You

can find more information in the section How do I select multiple entries?.

You have the following options for working with folders:

Each entry is made up of three elements: contents (1), feed (2), and metadata.

The contents and metadata are shown on the left, while the feed is always located on the right.

You can switch between the contents, metadata, and full text using the tabs.

Metadata: Depending on the configuration, some parts of the form may appear collapsed

with gen. 2 metadata. To expand a part of the form, click the arrow to the left of the header.

Full text: When you click the Full text button, the selected document appears in full text. This

requires the document to have been added to the full text database. This display lends itself

to searches. A search field allowing you to search the text appears below it. For more

information about the search field on the Full text tab, refer to the Preview section in the 

'View' group chapter.

metadata. You can also group the entries.

Select the respective name of the table column from the drop-down menus.

61 ELO Desktop Client



Metadata 

Before you can file documents to ELO or create new folders, you must enter metadata for the

entries. This is done by using metadata forms, which contain corresponding input fields (called 

fields).

The Metadata dialog box is used to enter and edit the metadata. The dialog box usually appears

automatically when you file a document or create a folder.

For more information on metadata, refer to the Metadata section in the 'Organize' group chapter.

62 ELO Desktop Client



Feed 

ELO offers several features that support collaboration within your company.

The feed is used to share information on an entry in ELO (document or folder) and track changes.

The following message types are shown in the feed:

Posts (written by a user)

Comment (on a post)

Polls

Events (e.g. when a new version of a document is filed or changes are made to the working

version)

Create post 

Use the Create a post field to comment on the respective entry in a feed. Click the input field.

The text in posts, polls, and comments can be formatted with the following syntax:

Bold: To format a part of the text in bold type, place an asterisk (*) at the beginning and end of the

desired text section.

Status: Different statuses 

Available in: Desktop work area

The ELO Desktop Client recognizes the status of open Microsoft Office documents as well as files in

the Windows Explorer and Windows Desktop. In the Desktop work area, the different statuses are

indicated in the Status area.

'Not filed' status

The Not filed status indicates that the

document has not been filed to ELO.

You can either save the file as a new

document or as a new version of the

document.

'Found in ELO' status

The Found in ELO status indicates that the

document selected at the file system level is

already filed to ELO. You can replace the

selected file with an ELO link, file a new

version of a document, or go to the location

where the entry is filed in ELO.

Please note

If you open the file from the Windows file system, the ELO Desktop Client can no longer

recognize the status due to a lock. In this case, you can either go to the location where the

entry is filed in ELO or replace the file with an ELO link. We recommend checking the

document out in the client to edit it.

72 ELO Desktop Client



'View' status

The View status indicates that a document

filed in ELO is opened for viewing in an

external program. You can check out and edit

the document or file it as a new version.

Once you have changed and saved the

document in an external program, the status

switches to In use.

'In use' status

The In use status indicates that a document filed to

ELO is currently being edited in a Microsoft Office

program. You can check the document in, file it as a

new version, or discard your changes.

'In use by a web service' status

The In use by a web service status

indicates that a document filed to

ELO is currently being edited in a

Microsoft Office program via a web

service. This requires ELO to be

connected as a drive.

'Status not recognized'

The Status not recognized status indicates

that the Windows user does not have read

access to the document, or that an

application is blocking read access.

the document.

The old version is still retained.

While the document is checked out, it is locked for other users. During this time, other users can

only view the document in read-only mode (Document > Open in ready-only mode). This prevents

a document from being edited by multiple users at the same time, resulting in conflicting versions.

Metadata 

This function allows you to view the metadata for the entry.

If you have permission, you can edit the metadata.

Metadata is data about a folder or a document. It includes information on the entry itself, for

example when it was filed, or its name in the Repository work area. It also includes the permissions

structure for the entry, meaning which users have what access to the entry. The quality of a

repository depends to a great extent on the quality of the metadata. Metadata allows you to

organize documents in a standardized way and file them quickly to ELO. In addition, using

metadata makes it easier to find documents.

A new metadata model was introduced with version ELO 21 in addition to the previous metadata

model. Both models are used in parallel. In the following, these metadata models are referred to as

generation 1 (gen. 1) and generation 2 (gen. 2).

In gen. 2, forms and metadata forms are shown differently in the Metadata dialog box. The

metadata concept will remain the same.

There are three ways to open the Metadata dialog box manually. Select an entry and

Please note

When you change the metadata form, metadata may be lost or incorrectly assigned.

Fields 

The metadata for a document is entered into fields.

The type of field determines the data you need to enter and what you need to consider when doing

so. There are different types of fields, which can be configured differently from metadata form to

metadata form.

Text field: You can enter letters, numbers, and special characters in a text field.

Mandatory field: Fields can be configured as mandatory to complete the metadata entry. A red

asterisk or a red marking indicates that a field is mandatory. If there are any conflicts, a warning

The following tools are available:

Keyword list

Drop-down menu

this option is enabled, documents are processed for the full text database and can be then found

using the full text search. This requires the document to contain text information.
