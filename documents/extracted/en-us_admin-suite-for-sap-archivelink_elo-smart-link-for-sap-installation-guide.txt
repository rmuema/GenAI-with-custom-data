Installation 

To install the interface, go to the ELO SupportWeb and download the current version of ELO Smart

Link to the ELO server, then extract the files to a temporary folder.

You will find the installation files on the ELO SupportWeb under Integrations > ELO for SAP® ERP >

ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® > ELO Smart Link for SAP® ERP.

Installing Apache Tomcat 

Within ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise, you can install another Apache Tomcat e.g. for the ELO

Smart Link interface from the ELO Server Setup. Depending on the installation and version of the

system, you will find the server setup in the server's installation directory.

Please not

Make sure to run the ELO Server Setup as administrator.

Click the Application Servers tab.

Under ELO Server Engines, click Add to create a new entry.

Enter a name, the maximum memory, and a port for the Tomcat you are creating. In our

example, we use the following data:

Name: ELO-ELOCCDEMO11-SL

Maximum memory (MB): 1024

Port: 9060

Information

The ELO Smart Link instance name should only contain uppercase and lowercase letters,

numbers, the minus sign, and underscores. The instance name cannot be longer than

180 characters.

Follow the server setup instructions to install the new Apache Tomcats (ELO-ELOCCDEMO11-

SL in the example). Installation can take several minutes, and you will see the various steps

as the installation proceeds. The installation is completed when you see the entry Finished –

SUCCESS.

Complete the installation and close the ELO Server Setup.

Before you start to install and configure the ELO Smart Link interface, you should stop the

new service (here: ELOCCDEMO11-SL).

Information

The SAP Java Connector libraries can also be installed in the corresponding directories when

installing the Tomcat. Simply copy the .ZIP file to the temporary installation directory of the

ELO Server Setup into the /repository folder. Example: C:\temp\ELO server setup\repository.

Refer to the chapter SAP Java Connector libraries, which describes how to store these files

manually.

Installing additional instances 

Please note

Another instance on the same Indexserver or Tomcat is not usually required and does not

bring significant advantages. Therefore, only carry out the following steps if you really need

to.

If you want to run more than one instance on an ELO Application Server (Tomcat), you will have to

provide an additional library on this Tomcat.

Open the ZIP directory.

Fig.: Contents of the 'smartLink.war' file

Before starting the Tomcat, extract the smartLink.war ZIP file, then copy the 

sharedRfcAccess.jar file located in the *\resources* directory to the Tomcat *lib* directory.

This library enables multiple ELO Smart Link instances to access the SAP Java Connector.

Information

The ELO Smart Link instance name should only contain uppercase and lowercase letters,

numbers, the minus sign, and underscores. The instance name cannot be longer than

180 characters.

!['resources' webapps directory](../../en-us/elo-smart-link-for-sap-installation-guide/installation/resources-webapps-dir

*Fig.: 'resources' webapps directory*

**Alternative**: A second option for obtaining the *sharedRfcAccess.jar* file is the *webapps* folder of the actual ELO S

Create a new directory within the Tomcat server for the new instance and then perform the

following steps.

If the file is not copied to this folder, you will receive the following error message when testing the

connection within an instance.

Fig.: Error during connection test

After copying this file, the connection test is successful.

Fig.: Connection test successful

Deploy the '.xml' file 

Switch to the directory that you just created on the Tomcat server (in our example ELO-

ELOCCDEMO11-SL) and then to the file path conf\Catalina\localhost.

Fig.: ELO Smart Link – Tomcat 'localhost' folder

Copy the XML file sl-<repository>.xml to this location, replacing <repository> with the name

of the repository where you want to file ELO Smart Link documents.

In our example, this is the following path:

E:\ELOprofessional\servers\ELO-ECLOCCDEMO11-SL\conf\Catalina\localhost

Information

If you need to connect multiple ELO repositories with ELO Smart Link, create a separate .xml

file for each repository. Use the naming convention sl-<repository>.xml.

Open the copied file – in our example sl-CCDEMO11.xml – with the following contents:

1. 

2. 

1. 

<?xmlversion="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

10 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Edit the paths of the following parameters:

docBase= always points to the ELO Smart Link .war file in the webapps directory.

path= sl-<Repository> indicates the path segment of the ELO Smart Link URL.

value= points to the directory of the configuration files.

Information

These are file path examples. You should also check the drive letters.

SAP Java Connector libraries 

To use the ELO Smart Link functions in conjunction with SAP, you need the SAP Java Connector

(JCo). For licensing reasons, ELO Digital Office GmbH is unable to supply the SAP Java Connector.

Notify your customers or SAP partners to this regard, as customers/partners require access to the 

SAP Software Downloads area to download it.

Provided you have the relevant permissions, you can download the required SAP Java Connector at

the following link. As the components contain both packages and system class libraries, the

system class libraries are platform-dependent.

SAP Support Portal: SAP Java Connector

For more information, go to the following link:

SAP documentation: SAP JCo installation

<Context docBase="D:\ELOenterprise\prog\webapps\smartLink.war" path="/sl-<repository>"

<Environment name="webappconfigdir" override="false" type="java.lang.String" value="D:\ELOenterprise\c

</Context>

Information

The SAP Java Connector 3.1 SDK released by SAP requires Windows systems to have

Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 C/C++ runtime libraries (see also SAP Note 2786882).

After installing this required environment, you will have to restart ELO Smart Link for SAP®

ERP.

As an example, after installing the environment in the Control Panel of a 64-bit Windows

system, you will see the following entry under Programs:

Fig.: Control Panel entry under 'Programs'

Once you have obtained the SAP Java Connector SAP JCo 3 libraries, extract them to a

temporary directory.

Fig.: Tomcat – 'lib' and 'bin' directories

Copy the sapjco3.jar file to the lib directory of the Tomcat server and the sapjco3.dll file to

the bin directory of the Tomcat server.

ELO Smart Link is now installed.

Information

This is an example implementation. The native libraries of the JCo may not be DLL files on

other operating systems. For example, the native libraries on Linux have the extension .so

and have to be copied to either the LIB or BIN directory.

The platform-dependent requirements also have to be met for the respective version

(example: on Windows, the C/C++ runtime library).

Start the service 

Open the Windows Task Manager.

SL).

As soon as the service has the status Running, you can access the ELO Smart Link configuration

interface from the browser.

Information

Before you proceed with configuring ELO Smart Link, make sure that the Windows user

configured in the service has write access to the Tomcat directories.

Information 

Temporary ELO Smart Link directory 

Fig.: Path to Java options

14 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Fig.: Tomcat Java options

ELO Smart Link requires a temporary directory. The standard directory of the Tomcat is used here

(Fig. Tomcat Java options). If this directory does not exist or the user does not have write rights to

this directory, errors will occur.

Log messages 

RF_erp_sap_conn_service_GetInstanceUrls 

You may find a message for the RF_erp_sap_conn_service_GetInstanceUrls function in the ELO

Smart Link log. In the ELO Smart Link interface in the content repository, this function shows

information on other instances that are configured and used with the Data transfer function in the

ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP®. If ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP® – Datatransfer was not

installed on the system, a message may appear in the ELO Smart Link log indicating that the

corresponding script could not be found.
