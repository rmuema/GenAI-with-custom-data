Requirements 

The following requirements apply for the installation and use of the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams.

App registration in Microsoft Azure 

To install the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams, you need to register the app in Microsoft Azure.

You can read how to do this under Initial app registration in Microsoft Azure.

ELOauth 

Another requirement for using the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams is the ELOauth plug-in.

The ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams requires a configuration named "azure_oauth" in the ELOauth plug-

in, which allows the Microsoft Teams user to sign in to ELO.

If you want to use a name other than "azure_oauth", you need to modify it in the appsettings.json

file in the ELO Bot installation folder.

ELOauth is automatically rolled out with the installation of the ELO Bot from the ELO Server Setup.

You can get detailed information about ELOauth in the documentation ELOauth Plug-in.

As with the ELO Bot, ELOauth is registered as a Microsoft Azure service in the ELO Administration

Console. You will find more information on registering a service in the ELO Azure Administration

documentation.

Installation 

The ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams is installed via the ELO Application Manager from the ELO Server

Setup. The ELO Bot is not installed by default and must be installed separately.

The ELO Bot is registered and run as a Linux/Windows service. It is a self-contained package, which

means that .NET runtime is included.

Prior to installation, you need to register the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams as an app in Microsoft

Azure. You can read how to do this under Initial app registration in Microsoft Azure.

To install the ELO Bot, you will have to register the ELO Bot as a service in the ELO Azure

Administration. To learn how to register a service in the ELO Azure Administration, refer to the

documentation ELO Azure Administration.

Deploying the ELO Bot in Microsoft Teams 

When registering the ELO Bot as a service in the ELO Azure Administration, a manifest file is

provided. Download this manifest file and deploy it to the ELO Bot in Microsoft Teams. You require

administrator rights to deploy the bot to Microsoft Teams.

You deploy the ELO Bot in Microsoft Teams as an app on the Apps tab.

Method

Click the Manage apps button.1.

Result

Once selected, the ELO Bot is deployed to Microsoft Teams where the app can be added.

Please note

Important: If any of the data associated with the ELO Bot changes, e.g. the bot base URL,

you need to go through the deployment process again. In this case, you need to delete the

deployment first. On the dashboard, click the action Delete deployment. First you need to

manually delete the ELO Bot app in Microsoft Teams. A new ELO Bot manifest file is provided

after deployment. Use this manifest file to deploy the ELO Bot to Microsoft Teams again.

Refer to the chapter Configuration to learn how to set up the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams.

Configuration 

In order to use ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams, you first need to add the app to Microsoft Teams.

Go to Apps > Upload custom apps, and upload the manifest (ZIP file). If the manifest is loaded

correctly, the app will appear. Select the app and click Add.

One you have added the app, you need to restart Microsoft Teams.

You can start chatting with the bot by typing hi, hello, or menu. The ELO Bot responses are created

using adaptive cards.

Once you have integrated the ELO Bot for Microsoft Teams, you will need to authenticate again in

Microsoft Azure the first time you interact with the bot. Start the chat with hi, hello, or menu. You

will see a button for authenticating in Microsoft Azure on the adaptive card. Click this button to go

through the authentication process.

For authentication to work, you need to link the corresponding users in the ELO Administration

Console to the e-mail account for Microsoft Azure.

To interact with the ELO Bot, you must explicitly add the bot to a team. To add the bot to a team,

click the button Apps > Open > Drop-down arrow > Select a team.

You can make additional configurations in the appsettings.json file. This file is stored in the

installation folder.

For example, in appsettings.json, you can configure the number of results to be displayed.

If you want to use a repository in the ELO Bot, the proxy server of this ELO instance must know the

ELO Bot. You need to add the /bot/=<IP address of bot> entry to the corresponding 

de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy.properties file.

The Microsoft Teams user must authenticate with SSO to obtain access to the context-free functions

of ELO Business Solutions in Microsoft Teams. In the ELO Bot, switch to the Business Solutions tab.

If you are not already authenticated, SSO authentication is performed when you switch tabs. Once

you have done this, you can access the functions on the tab as well as in other areas of Microsoft

Teams.

The same applies for ELO Flows. However, in the current version, only the ELO Flows triggers are

supported and not the ELO Flows web apps.
