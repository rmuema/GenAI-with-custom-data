ELO Smart Link configuration 

Logon via the web interface 

Open a browser and call the ELO Smart Link URL. Use the name created in the configuration

files during installation.

To configure the interface, we recommend using the current version of one of the following

browsers:

Firefox

Google Chrome

In our example, the URL is as follows:

1. 

• 

• 

http://localhost:9060/sl-CCDEMO11/

4 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



User right 

Only users with the corresponding permissions in the ELO user manager can log on to the ELO

Smart Link web interface. This requires the SAP administrator user right in the ELO Administration

Console.

ELO Smart Link configuration start screen 

After you successfully log on to the web interface, the ELO Smart Link start screen opens. The web

interface is divided into different configuration areas.

5 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



1 Main toolbar: This contains several functions of the ELO Smart Link interface, specifically for

importing and exporting configuration files as well as the certificate manager. You also see the

account you are logged on with. Selecting the Log off button logs you out of ELO Smart Link.

2 Status bar: This bar is located on the left. It provides information on the status of the ELO Smart

Link interface, the ELO Smart Link instance name, and the version currently in use.

3 Configuration area: You will find more details on configured content repositories here.

Create new configuration 

Instances 

Information

Note that the ELO Smart Link web interface only shows instances if they are configured for

the same repository. Otherwise, log on separately for each ELO Smart Link instance to

perform configuration.

The ELO Smart Link instances are created by the installation wizard. The _ALL instance refers to the

default instance. This is always supplied.

If a content repository is assigned to the _ALL instance, you can choose what instance the content

repository should run on in the SAP configuration (transaction OAC0) (via the URL (server/port/path).

As the _ALL name indicates, all ELO Smart Link instances visible in the web interface are possible.

The instance name ELOCCDEMO11-SL2 used in this example was defined in the <entry

key="instancename"> parameter of the config.xml file during installation.

Selecting the gear icon opens the configuration for the instance.

Information

Changes to these values must be confirmed by restarting the Windows service for the

instance.

In the Instance scheduler, you can maintain two parameters.

The first parameter specifies the interval for processing the queue in seconds. This

serves as a timer for processing individual jobs, such as index downloads, barcode

uploads, and data transfers.

The second parameter Queue defines the working directory of ELO Smart Link for SAP

and is created in the Administration folder of the ELO repository on installation (Smart

Link Base). Here, individual processes are stored and logged in the form of a queue.

2. 

◦ 

◦ 

7 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Besides index download and barcode upload, the queue entries of the Function module

mapping from ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP® ERP – Datatransfer are also filed here in

JSON format (depending on the configuration – queue). Depending on the status (ToDo, 

Error, and Finished), it may be necessary for a system administrator to check this area.

The parameter to be configured indicates the number of days after which completed

entries (in the Finished folder) are marked for deletion. The maximum value is 99 days.

The value 0 days disables the function to mark objects for deletion for the _ALL

instance. If an instance is defined (example <ELOCCDEMO11-SL2>), the value 0

inherits the settings of the ALL instance. The value -1 disables the function. Note that

one entry is written per process, meaning space is used in the ELO repository. We

recommend configuring this parameter to ensure logging does not take up too much

space. The ELO administrator can delete log data sets marked for deletion

permanently.

Click Disable to disable these functions. Please note here as well that in the _ALL

instance, this function sets the value to 0 for all instances without an explicit

configuration, thus disabling the function. For explicit instances, the value is set to -1,

disabling processing for the selected instance.

The Apply global configuration function applies the settings from your _ALL instance.

The Reset function allows you to delete all configured value and configure the instance

anew.

Confirm the configuration with the Apply button.

In the footer of the web interface, you will see a note regarding changes to the configuration.

Confirm the changes with the Save changes button.

If the connection is successful, you will see a corresponding pop-up message.

If the connection test is successful, you can begin configuring the content repositories.

SAP systems when using an SAProuter string 

The SAP system landscape may only be available through an SAProuter string. A route string

describes a connection between two hosts through one or more SAProuter instances. Each of these

SAProuter instances checks whether the connection between the predecessor and the successor is

permitted based on the route permission table and in this case it establishes the connection.

SAP systems when using a message server 

To load-balance SAP systems, customer installations may have a message server.

1. 

12 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



To connect ELO Smart Link to a message server, enable the option Logon via message server.

If this function is enabled, establishing a connection between ELO Smart Link and the SAP

message server requires additional configurations.

Parameter Description
Example

Secure login via SNC 

You can learn how to set up secure communication for RFC using SNC in the Secure login via SNC

chapter.

Content repository 

The connection between ELO and an SAP system is established via a content repository. To the SAP

system, ELO acts as a content server where documents can be filed.

2. 

13 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Create a new content repository with one of the following functions.

Please note

The name of the content repository can no longer be changed. In this case, you have to

create a new content repository and delete the incorrect one.

Also note that the name of the content repository you want to connect must be identical to

the name of the content repository in SAP (transaction OAC0).

From the point of view of the SAP system, a document can be uniquely identified based on a

key in the content repository as well as the SAP ArchiveLink document ID. It is therefore

important that you avoid using identical content repositories in different SAP systems.

1. 

14 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



In the first input field, enter the name of the content repository. Use the entry configured in

SAP (transaction OAC0). The content repository name always consists of two characters.

Note the capitalization rules, e.g. E1 or EL.

The second input field is for describing the content repository. Enter a descriptive text

corresponding to your configuration here. This can match the descriptive text from the SAP

content repository (e.g. ELO document management).

In the third field, enter the metadata form to be assigned to an object when filed to ELO. The 

SAPDATA metadata form can be configured/created as a default value in ELO.

Click an instance to select it. It will then be highlighted in dark gray.

In the next step, select the functions required for this content repository by enabling them.

15 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



The Index download function determines possible metadata for a document from SAP

and provides it in ELO for the filed document in the corresponding metadata form.

Information

These functions require a valid license key for the ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP® ERP

product. You should also note that this requires additional installations and configurations.

You will find more information on ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP® ERP on the ELO

SupportWeb under Integrations > ELO for SAP® ERP > ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink®.

The Barcode upload function links scanned paper document and SAP objects via a barcode.

You can find more information on this in the Barcode upload section.

Information

The Barcode upload function is part of ELO Smart Link and is therefore included with the

respective license.

If you need and use index download in the project, enable the function and configure the RFC

function from SAP here. The ELO default RFC function is: /ELO/KEY_EXPORT. For more information,

refer to the ELO Connectivity Pack for SAP® ERP – Indexdownload documentation.

Finally, select the SAP system where the content repository is configured. When using index

download or barcode upload, you must select an SAP system.

Please note

Only one SAP system, configured in the previously selected instance (defined instance or

"_ALL"), can be allocated.

Confirm your configuration with OK and save the settings in the footer of the next dialog box.

In the ELO Smart Link web interface, you now see your content repository with the

parameters you configured.

The content repository has now been created and can be used.

Click the content repository to open it and configure additional settings.2. 

17 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Properties 

In the Properties configuration area, you will find all general information, some of which you

provided when creating the content repository.

Disabling a content repository

You also have the option to disable and re-enable the content repository. After disabling the content

repository, it can no longer be reached by the SAP system and no more documents can be filed.

Enabling signatures

The signature must match the SAP system configuration. If you do not want to use a signature,

enable the No signature function in the content repository configuration. For more information on

configuring SAP, refer to SAP ArchiveLink® configuration.

Index download 

In the Index download area, you can enable/disable index downloads and make changes to the

applicable SAP RFC function. The SAP system performing the index download in this content

repository is configured in the Properties area.

18 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Barcode upload 

If the Barcode upload function is enabled, you can configure additional settings in the following

area. The SAP system performing the index download in this content repository is configured in the 

Properties area.

Enable/disable barcode upload

To enable/disable barcode upload for this content repository, click Enable or Disable.

Enable/disable extension derivation

With barcode uploads, a document class is reported to the SAP system. By default, this is the

document class FAX, which is entered into the TOA tables in SAP when using the function. By

enabling the Derive document class from extension function, the actual extension is transferred to

SAP as the document class in capital letters.

File extension from metadata field

Alternatively, you can use the Metadata field for document class function to create your own field

and pass on the document class to this field for each document.

This process is as follows:

If a value is entered to Field for document class and this field also has a value in the

document to be processed, this value is applied for uploading the document via barcode

upload.

If no value is configured for Field for document class but a document class is entered to the 

Derive document class from extension field, this entry is used.

If neither of these parameters is configured, the default value FAX is applied.

ELOix function for barcode search

You can enter an ELO Indexserver function into the ELO Indexserver function for barcode search

configuration parameter in order to find documents with barcode entries to be transferred. This can

be necessary, for example, to define a more performant database query if there are issues

performing normal searches on specific database systems. It is also possible to perform upstream

•

19 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



actions in the configured script, such as creating a correct SAPPATH. In most cases, it is not

necessary to use an additional function.

The specified scripts must be located in the ELO Indexserver Scripting Base administration folder in

the corresponding directory for the ELO Smart Link for SAP® ERP instance (in our example, the 

_ALL directory). An example of a script could look like this:

/**

* Import Indexserver API classes

*/

importPackage(Packages.de.elo.ix.client);

/**

* This function collects barcode documents for the ELO Archive Link

* @param {de.elo.ix.client.IXServerEventsContext} ec Execution context, members:

function RF_findBarcodeDocs(ec, args) {

  var db = new Packages.de.elo.ix.jscript.DBConnection(),

      ret = [], repositoryName, maskName, bcReposLine;

  if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {

    log.debug("RF_findBarcodeDocs(" + ec + ", args=" + args);

  }

  repositoryName = args[0];

Metadata 

In the following configuration area, you can define and set parameters related to the metadata.

Please note that the following knowledge is required to configure these parameters.

  //  if it has to be included in the statement:

  //

  //    var maskId = parseInt(maskName);

  //    log.info("maskId=" + maskId);

  //    if (isNaN(maskId)) {

  //      var mask = ix.checkoutDocMask(ec.ci, maskName, DocMaskC.mbAll, LockC.NO);

  //      maskId = mask.id;

  //      log.info("maskId=" + maskId);

  //    }

  ret = db.query("select distinct k1.parentid from objkeys k1, objkeys k2 " +

                         "where k1.parentid=k2.parentid and " +

                         "k1.okeydata like '?%' and " +

                         "k1.okeyname like 'SAPBARC' and " +

                         "k2.okeydata like '" + repositoryName +"/%' and " +

                         "k2.okeyname like 'SAPPATH'");

  if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {

    log.debug("#rows=" + ret.length);

  }

  if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {

    log.debug(")RF_findBarcodeDocs");

  }

  return ret;

}

21 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



The SAP system transfers both the actual document and the corresponding header data to ELO

Smart Link during filing.

A document also always transfers a linked path, which is configured in a field on the metadata

form. In the SAP context, this path is named SAP repository path and is structured as follows:

Component metadata

You have three options for configuring the Component metadata field:

If the component ID is entered, e.g. data, the fields are saved in the specified component.

If * is entered as the component ID, the fields are saved in all components.

If the component ID is blank, the fields of the document (document header) are set.

Ignore metadata fields

In the Metadata fields are deleted if the entry exists input field, you can define a range of fields that

are left blank if values already exist. The fields are listed separated by commas.

Example: INVOICE_DATE, INVOICE_AMOUNT etc.…

Overwrite field values

This setting in the configuration prevents field values from being overwritten. If you enable this

function, field values can be overwritten. Use the input field below it: Prior to update, metadata

fields are deleted. The fields are listed separated by commas.

Example: INVOICE, INVOICE_STATE etc.…

Setting initial values

In this configuration parameter, initial values can be written to a field during document filing

(component/data) or from the header file (document). You may want to do this to start a workflow

via an ELOas script, for example. For more information, refer to Advanced > Document header

name.

If you enable one of the two functions When creating a component, no initial values are set or 

When creating a document, no initial values are set, two additional fields are shown in the

configuration interface.

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

22 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



The field Init metadata field specifies the field you want to complete automatically. For

example, the WF_STATE field.

The Init metadata value field specifies the fixed value you want to enter into the defined field.

For example, the value Start.

Advanced 

You will find more configuration options under Advanced.

ELO document path

With the ELO document path, you can file archived documents to your own document path

(physical storage location).

Example:

• 

23 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Log on to the ELO Administration Console and create your own document path.

Next, enter the name of the document path into the ELO document path input field in the 

Advanced menu of the ELO Smart Link configuration. For example, the value sapdocuments. If

this value is left blank, the default path is used.

Permission (ACL)

The configured permissions are applied globally to all filed SAP documents from this content

repository. To configure multiple permissions, create separate entries for the corresponding groups

or IDs. Use the access right codes used by ELO as the abbreviations for the rights. If using the ID,

make sure to enter the # character before the group or user ID.

R (Read), W (Write), D (Delete), E (Edit), and P (Permission).

Information

Starting with ELO 12, you can use the new right Permission (P). If you use ELO 11 or an older

version, you cannot use the Permission (P) right. Otherwise, all entries with the Permission

(P) right will become invalid! Whenever possible, avoid performing configuration at the user

level.

ELO replication sets

Another configuration option is available for ELO replication sets. You have the option to assign the

stored documents from this content repository to one or more ELO replication sets.

Option 2: [#]Replication ID

Use the replication set name or replication set ID as a configuration parameter in the Content

repository – Advanced area of ELO Smart Link for SAP. If you leave the parameter field empty, no

replication set will be used. To configure multiple replication sets, use the ENTER key, commas, or

the TAB key after inputting an entry.

24 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Key to encrypt and decrypt components

If you want to store documents using ELO Smart Link, you can encrypt them before filing to the

repository. The AES algorithm of the Java SE platform is used for this. By default, the ELO Smart

Link interface generates 128-bit keys. If the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files modules

from Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) are installed, 256-bit keys are generated.

Information

If performing a migration for files that were previously 128-bit encrypted, this encryption

must be maintained, as the system automatically enters the key. Do not switch to a higher

encryption type.

The encrypted documents are saved with the extension .eloaes. The file streams contain a simple

header specifying the size and extension of the original document. The encryption process and

header layout can be requested from ELO.

ELO Smart Link can also generate a key. These keys are only generated with the AES algorithm. To

do so, proceed as follows:

In the Key to encrypt and decrypt components field, enter generate.

Apply the configuration settings by clicking the Apply button at the top right and save your

changes.

Open the Advanced content repository configuration again and check whether a key has been

entered into the Key to encrypt and decrypt components input field.

Warning

If the encryption code is lost, you will no longer be able to decrypt encrypted documents.

Keep this key in a secure location.

Encryption algorithm

If encryption is used, complete the Encryption algorithm input field. This parameter must be

configured together with Key to encrypt and decrypt components. The values AES and AES/ECB/

NoPadding have been tested by quality assurance.

1. 

2. 

3. 

25 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



To ensure compatibility with older installations running Java 7, you have to select AES/ECB/

NoPadding for the key to work.

If you'd like to use encryption, we recommend setting the value AES/ECB/NoPadding. If you leave

this configuration parameter blank, encryption is not performed.

Please note

If using encryption, documents can only be displayed directly via SAP with direct access via

ELO Smart Link. SAP has to be set to the internal SAP document viewer. No other ELO client

can decrypt the documents. Other functions, such as going straight to the ELO Java Client or

ELO Web Client, cannot be used either, for example.

ELOix function for finding documents to be deleted

The ELOix function for finding documents to be deleted configuration parameter should only be

used in case of issues or as needed. In the past, performance issues arose when deleting

documents for some database systems/ELO versions. In this case, this option can be used. Enter a

registered ELOix function configured in ELO in the Indexserver Scripting Base. This ELO Indexserver

function should contain optimized searches at the database level.

Example: When searching for documents with an Oracle database using the normal approach,

timeout errors could occur.

The following sample script was developed for this specific case:

/**

* Example script to replace the SQL statement in componentDelete.

 *

 * Copy this script file into the archive folder

 * \Administration\ELO Indexserver Scripting Base\_ALL

*/

/**

* Statement to be used to find the ELO archive entries of a SAP document.

* The placeholders {0} and {1} are replaced by the SAPPATH when the statement is executed.

*/

var stmt_findSordForDeleteDocument =

      "select objid from objekte o, objkeys objk0"

                        + " where"

                        + " o.objid=objk0.parentid"

                        + " and (objk0.okeyname like N'SAPPATH')"

    // ORACLE: use okeyudata

26 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



End points with write permissions

In this configuration parameter, you can specify host names or IP addresses with write, edit, and/or

delete permissions.

Example:

                        + " and ((objk0.okeydata like N'{0}')"

                        + "   or  (objk0.okeydata  like N'{1}/%'))"

    // ORACLE : + " and (rownum<=10001)"

                  + " and (o.objstatus=0)"

                        + " and (o.objid>1)"

                  ;

/**

* Import Indexserver API classes

*/

importPackage(Packages.de.elo.ix.client);

/**

* Registered function called from ELO Smart Link

* @param ec Execution Context

* @param args Array of arguments

* @returns Table of results

*/

function RF_findSordForDeleteDocument(ec, args) {

      if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug("RF_findSordForDeleteDocument(" + ec + ", args=" + args);

      //var repositoryName = args[0];

      //var maskName = args[1];

      var sappath = args[2];

      var db = new Packages.de.elo.ix.jscript.DBConnection();

      var ret = db.query(stmt_findSordForDeleteDocument, [sappath, sappath]);

      if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug(")RF_findSordForDeleteDocument");

      return ret;

}

27 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Only SAP systems with the IP addresses 10.49.110.187 and 10.49.50.39 may create, change, or

delete documents.

Document protection

Document protection determines whether the content server requires signed access. Normally, the

degree of protection of a document is set by SAP for each document on creation and saving. If it is

not set, the value specified here is used (r = read, u = update, c = create, d = delete). The default

value means that only signed access is permitted (maximum security).

ELO Web Client URL

If you enter the URL for the ELO Web Client here, all Get access (document calls) are forwarded to

the URL of the ELO Web Client. The configured URL must contain the path to the repository.

Example:

Entering the ELO Web Client URL allows you to go from the SAP attachment list to the ELO Web

Client when opening a document from the attachment list. However, this requires additional

configurations in SAP, which are described in the chapter ELO Web Client configuration.

Document header name

The parameter maintained here indicates the name of the document header, which is generated

together with the document filed via SAP. If this field is left empty, the default value Document is

used. Note the following explanations.

In SAP ArchiveLink®, two files are always stored for each document filed. The following graphic

explains the default storage process in SAP. In ELO, this is a document and header file, and in SAP it

is a component/data and a document.

Compatibility mode

Please note

Only use this mode if you are familiar with the consequences and functions.

If compatibility mode has been enabled, objects can be requested via the ELO ID instead of the

SAPPATH generated by SAP. Furthermore, there are no separate repository entries for separating

documents and component properties. The writeBarcodeFile function is also performed differently

than the standard. In compatibility mode, write access is also disabled. As a result, you cannot

create any components, for example.

Compression mode

If this parameter was enabled, documents to be filed from the SAP system are compressed before

they are transferred to ELO. The standard ZIP compression algorithm of the Java platform is used,

and the files are transferred to ELO zipped.

Use Indexserver as fallback if document content type is missing

By default, no content type is transferred in the header when requesting a document from ELO from

the SAP system, unless a content type is explicitly set in field SAPCONT. This can cause issues with

the SAP system, as the SAP system may set an incorrect extension for the document (e.g. the SAP

system sets .mdb as the extension).

If you enable this menu item, a fallback value will be set based on the file type on the Indexserver

and transferred to the SAP system. Please note that this could cause a certification test for ELO

Smart Link for SAP® ERP (SAP ArchiveLink) on your SAP system to fail. Another option is to

maintain the SAPCONT field in ELO with the corresponding content type (or mime type).

Certificate configuration 

If the Signature parameter is enabled in the ELO Smart Link Properties menu (see Properties >

Enabling signatures), ELO Smart Link for SAP only accepts signed requests from an SAP system.

However, the connected SAP system can sign and send its requests with a (public key) certificate.

For ELO Smart Link to verify the request, the certificate must be sent from SAP to ELO Smart Link,

where it has to be accepted and approved. This ensures only authorized systems have access. For

more information on sending a certificate, refer to the section Security settings.

We recommend managing certificates sent by SAP systems using the certificate manager. If this is

not possible, you can configure the system to accept sent certificates via the following parameters.

Accept next transferred certificate

29 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



If this parameter is enabled, ELO Smart Link will automatically accept the next certificate sent by

an SAP system. The parameter is then disabled again. If using this function, the certificate should

be sent from the corresponding SAP system to ELO Smart Link in a timely manner.

Accept all certificates

If this parameter is enabled, ELO Smart Link will automatically accept all incoming certificates.

Information

Only use this mode for test purposes.

Other 

Under Other, you can delete an existing content repository.

Apply the changes by selecting the Save changes button in the footer.

Certificate manager 

To work with the certificate manager, you should first set up corresponding content repositories and

configure them in the connected SAP systems. For more information, refer to the chapter SAP

ArchiveLink® configuration.

You will find the certificate manager on the toolbar of the ELO Smart Link web interface.

1. 

30 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



The certificate manager is split up into two different areas: Unverified certificates and Verified

certificates.

If a certificate is sent by an SAP system as described under Security settings, you will find it in the 

Unverified certificates area. You now have the option to accept the certificate (Approve) or discard

it.

Once you have accepted the unverified certificate, you will find it under Verified certificates.

31 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



If additional content repositories have been created for the same SAP system, you can copy the

existing and accepted certificate to another content repository. Under Verified certificates, you can

use the Transfer certificate to another content repository function.

Copy content repository 

When creating a new content repository, you can copy configurations you have already made for an

existing content repository.

To do this, you need to enable the option Copy from content repository.

If the option is enabled, you can enter the name and description of the new content

repository and select the content repository whose configuration parameters you want to

copy.

Migrating existing configurations 

With ELO Smart Link, you can import an old ELO Archive Link for SAP configuration or migrate

configurations from a test system to a live ELO Smart Link system. On the toolbar, you will find the 

Import and Export entries, which can be used for the following purposes.

1. 

2. 

32 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Exporting a configuration file 

The Export function allows you to save the current configuration in a directory on your local file

system.

Generated in JSON format, the file contains the complete configuration of ELO Smart Link and can

therefore also act as a backup.

Importing a configuration file 

Please note

The Overwrite settings function is enabled by default. The existing configuration is deleted

on import.

Switch to the ELO Smart Link installation where you want to upload the configuration using

the Import function.

On the toolbar, click Import and select the file you exported to your directory.

The selected file is shown and you can disable the function to overwrite existing entries.

When importing instances, the instance to be imported may not yet be entirely known to the

system. If this is the case, the instance is shown and you can choose which of the existing

instances you want to perform the import function on. If you select the default instance _ALL

here, you also have to choose which configuration is applied: the configuration for the _ALL

instance available on the server or the configuration of the instance that will be imported.

Next, the SAP systems to be imported are shown. Add the name of the SAP system, as well

as the password associated with the SAP user name. It is not possible to import an entry

without the name of the SAP system from an old ELO Archive Link for SAP configuration.

34 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



Please note

In the ELO ArchiveLink for SAP configuration, it was possible to enter incomplete

configurations. This did not have an effect on functionality. During import, these

configuration fragments are now allocated logically, but do not result in a complete

configuration. The incomplete SAP system has to be removed following import. You will

have to first remove the link in the corresponding content repository and then delete the

SAP system.

Allocation of SAP systems in a content repository is necessary for ELO Connectivity Pack for

SAP® ERP functions, such as the index download and barcode upload scenarios.

The system indicates the missing parameters and marks the fields with a red border.

In addition, all configuration items in all three areas are displayed on three tabs:

37 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



All information on the instance configuration

Please note

If the Overwrite settings function was disabled, the selected configuration is updated by

existing functions.

Migrating ELO Archive Link for SAP configurations 

ELO Smart Link for SAP is backwards compatible with ELO Archive Link. This means you can

migrate valid configuration files from ELO Archive Link for SAP.

Copy the configuration file from the old ELO Archive Link for SAP server to the new server or

your local client where you have access to the new ELO Smart Link.

Use the Import function on the toolbar as described in Importing a configuration file.

Clicking Apply/update enters all listed entries into the ELO Smart Link configuration.

Next, apply the configuration with Save changes in the footer.

SAP ArchiveLink® configuration 

Besides configuring ELO Smart Link, you need to set up a corresponding content repository on your

SAP system. In this guide, we will create and configure the content repository E1 as an example.

Log on to your SAP system and start the transaction OAC0.

You can see some SAP content repositories in the overview. These are used by SAP for

different purposes and shouldn't be deleted.

Switch to edit mode in the transaction (  icon) and click the  icon to create a new

content repository.

We use the following data in this example: There are two different view modes you can

switch between in the toolbar (simple and full administration).

Once you have made all settings and the ELO Smart Link service is running, you can test the

connection to ELO Smart Link in the content repository transaction.

If the test was successful, this is displayed in the SAP status line.

For more details, click the information icon (Status Information).

Security settings 

The next step is to check and configure the security settings. This setting also equates to the value

defined in the section Enabling signatures.

41 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



If the No signature check box is selected in SAP, you must disable the Signature enabled

parameter in the ELO Smart Link configuration.

If the check box is not selected in SAP, you must enable the Signature enabled parameter in

the ELO Smart Link configuration.

Now, you can send the certificate from SAP to ELO Smart Link. Click Send certificate

(envelope icon).

SAP now sends a certificate with public key to ELO Smart Link.

The configuration of the SAP ArchiveLink® interface is now completed.

As described in the section Certificate manager, accept the transmitted certificate.

The content repository can now communicate with ELO Smart Link.

Information

Several SAP ArchiveLink® customizings, such as document types and links, still have to be

configured for filing documents from SAP.

ELO Web Client configuration 

If the URL to the ELO Web Client is entered into the configuration of a content repository in ELO

Smart Link (see the section Advanced > ELO Web Client URL), several configurations have to be

made in SAP to call the ELO Web Client. For example, a protocol (transaction OAA3) must be

maintained in the content repository configuration in SAP (transaction OAC0), which has

communication type http configured for the Display Stored Document function.

You can either use an existing protocol or create a new one. You will find more information in the 

ELO SAP® OLE call documentation.
