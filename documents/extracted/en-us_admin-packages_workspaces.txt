Please note

If you make changes to the workspace type after workspace instances have been created,

these changes are applied to all existing workspace instances of this workspace type,

unless you've already made changes in the workspace instance in the corresponding area.

Roles added to the workspace type later on are not applied to existing workspace instances.

Basic data about the workspace type is entered in the Overview area.

Enter a technical name in the Identifier field.

Enter a translation variable into the Translation variable field.

This makes sense if the metadata form is used as an inheriting metadata form that acts as a

kind of parent category but is not intended for new objects. It can, however, be used for lists

and dashboards.

Option 2: Open the Advanced settings area and make an entry in the Translation variable and 

Name fields. The value in the Name field is displayed as a header for lists. It should be the

plural form of the document type. For the Invoice metadata form, enter Invoices, for

example.

Select Save workspace type.

The workspace type is saved.

Create views 

In the Views area, create different views for the workspace type.

Information

At least one metadata form must be set as a permitted form to be able to add views.

Select New view.

The New view dialog box opens.

Enter a translation variable into the Translation variable field.

Alternative: Select an existing translation variable with the List button (list icon).

The translation variable is automatically transferred into the Name field.

Select a view type.

The following choices are available:

Table view: The workspace type data is displayed as a table. You can adjust the table

columns in a later step.

Kanban view: The workspace type data is displayed as a kanban board. A kanban board

is divided into multiple columns which represent the steps of a process. A workspace

element can pass through the various stages of a process. The items are displayed as

tiles or cards which can be dragged to different columns on the board. Only fields with

a keyword list can be used in the kanban view.

Dashboard view: The data of a metadata form in the workspace can be displayed in a

dashboard. Dashboards serve to display various static values in charts. At least one

dashboard must be set up for the metadata form. For information on how to configure

dashboards for a metadata form, refer to Metadata > Metadata forms > Create

dashboards.

Select which metadata form to use for the view.

Optional: For a dashboard view, you must select a dashboard set up in the metadata form.

Select Apply.

Depending on the option selected, an associated dialog box may open. Refer to the following

sections for more information on the different dialog boxes:

'Table view' dialog box

'Kanban view' dialog box

'Dashboard view' dialog box

As soon as you've configured the view, select Save workspace type.

The workspace type is saved.

List of metadata forms 

To be able to create a list based on metadata forms, you will need a metadata form that inherits its

settings to other metadata forms. These metadata forms are also referred to as child metadata

forms.

If a metadata form with child metadata forms is selected, ELO automatically recognizes the child

metadata forms and applies them as a value in the list.

Define roles 

Different roles can be assigned for workspaces. Roles allow you to control rights for the workspace

and permissions to contents in the workspace.

In the Roles area, you can see which roles have been set up for the workspace and which settings

apply for the respective roles.

Information

When creating a workspace int he client, these roles are created as groups in ELO.

The following roles are created with default settings:

• 

24 ELO packages

Administrator. Other members can also be assigned the role of Administrator. Administrators

have all the rights to the workspace and all permissions to the contents in the workspace.

Member: Users with this role have the permissions to view, edit, and delete contents in the

workspace.

Information

The Administrator role cannot be edited or deleted.

You can also set authorization options for entries that were created in a workspace. For more

information, refer to the ELO Java Client documentation.

Overview of functions
