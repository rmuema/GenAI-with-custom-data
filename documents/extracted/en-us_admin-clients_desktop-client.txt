Connect to ELO 

Before working with the client for the first time, you have to establish a connection to ELO.

Optional: If the Log on with the Windows user option is enabled, the Windows user and

Windows password are entered automatically. SSO (single sign-on) has to be set up in

Windows first.

Optional: If the Save password option is enabled, you are logged in automatically the next

time you start the ELO Desktop Client. You can save the password for each profile. To see

what passwords have been saved, go to the Administration category under Profile

management and click the key icon. You can also remove passwords here.

In the Repository area, you will see the name of the connected ELO repository. A checkmark

next to the profile name indicates that the repository is available.

To connect to the ELO repository, click Connect.

Optional: The first time you log on to the repository, the Functional roles dialog box opens

provided that your user account is assigned to a group.

Functional roles allow you to use different sets of rights and permissions for different

tasks. Groups can be defined as functional roles in the ELO Administration Console.

In this dialog box, you can choose which functional roles you want to enable. You can save

your selection. The dialog box then no longer appears the next time you log on.

The Enable roles function in the User menu [your name] allows you to change the roles.

Result

A connection has been established with the ELO repository. The ELO Desktop Client tile navigation

opens.

Configuration 

In this chapter, you will learn how you can make changes to the configuration as an administrator.

You will also find more information on integrating WebDAV without SSO and setting the ELO

Desktop Client Plus right in the ELO Administration Console.

Making universal changes to the configuration 

Settings in the configuration are always assigned to a specific user. If no settings have been made

for the user, the option group settings for the groups the user is a member of are applied.

Please note

Option groups cannot be used to transfer permissions.

If there are no settings for the user in the option groups, the global settings take effect. If no

options have been configured at the level of global settings, the preset client configuration is used.

First, the settings are evaluated for the user, if settings have been applied there. Afterwards, the

permission levels are evaluated in the order described above.

How can you check the settings for a level?

Method

As administrator, open the configuration from the drop-down menu in the header.1. 

12 Client administration



The Configuration dialog box opens.

Click Change user.

The Select user dialog box appears.

Select the desired user or group from the drop-down menu.

Click OK.

Result

The name of the selected user or group is now shown at the top left in the configuration.

A new column appears in the configuration next to the settings. The Set by column shows at what

level changes have been made to settings. You can show and hide the Set by column using the

button in the configuration header.

Transfer settings 

In the example above, a specific path is set to default for the document templates in the General

area. Change these settings for a specific user and select a different filing path.

14 Client administration



The setting for this option at the level of the User (see figure: Levels concept in the configuration)

overrides all settings at all levels below it. You can delete the settings for the currently selected

option group or user by clicking the X in the column.

You can transfer the current settings to other users by clicking the yellow arrow button in the

configuration header.

Method

Click Transfer settings (yellow arrow).1. 

15 Client administration



The Transfer settings dialog box opens.

First, select the users or option groups you want to transfer the settings to from the drop-

down menu. You can select multiple users or groups. They are shown in a list. Remove

individual users or groups by clicking the x button.

Optional: To replace user-defined settings with group settings, check the corresponding box.

To transfer all settings, click All.

Alternative: To only transfer the settings changed by the user, click Only modified.

16 Client administration



Optional: Check the settings you want to transfer. You can transfer individual areas of the

configuration by checking the corresponding boxes. Alternatively, you can select individual

settings separately by expanding the areas.

To transfer the settings, click OK.

Load settings 

To open a saved configuration profile, click Load existing settings for the configuration (folder icon

at the top in the configuration header) and select a user profile file from the Windows file system in

the Open dialog box.

Save settings 

You can save the configuration to your Windows file system.

Method

Click the floppy disk icon in the header of the configuration to save the configuration settings

as an XML file.

configuration by checking the corresponding boxes. Alternatively, you can select individual

settings separately by expanding the areas.

To export the settings, click OK.

Select the path and file name on the Windows file system and click Save.

Result

The configuration profile is saved to the Windows file system as an XML file.

Integrate WebDAV without SSO 

If single sign-on (SSO) is not available for ELO Indexserver, you will have to change a setting in the 

WebClient Windows Service for WebDAV integration (Connect ELO as a drive function).

Method

In Windows, open the Registry Editor desktop app.

In the registry, navigate to the following key:

Create a new DWORD value named BasicAuthLevel if it does not already exist.

BasicAuthLevel has the following values:

0: authentication with user name/password disabled

1: authentication with user name/password only for SSL WebDAV directories

2: authentication with user name/password only for SSL WebDAV directories

Important

Setting the value 2 for BasicAuthLevel can enable potential hackers to steal

passwords, as the authentication process is not encrypted.

If you can connect to ELO Indexserver via HTTPS, change the value to 2. If only HTTP

connection is possible, change the value to 1.

Close the registry editor.

In Windows, open the Services app.
