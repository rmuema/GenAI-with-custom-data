2 ELO Integration Client



Installation and operation

Configuration 

You can configure what functions are made available in the ELO Integration Client. This

configuration determines which client root entry to show and what functions are available.

Functions that are not available are hidden.

Default configuration 

The client starts with a default configuration that is customized during start-up.

The configuration contains the following values:

Name Explanation
Type

[default]

guid The GUID of the root entry the client should show.
String

[null]

noForm
Prevents a form from being displayed for an entry in the

document view.

Boolean

[true]

noFeed
Prevents the feed from being displayed for an entry in the

document view.

Boolean

[true]

noFulltext
Prevents the full text content from being displayed for an

entry.

Boolean

[true]

noImagePreview Prevents the image preview from being displayed for an entry.
Boolean

[true]

rFInit Name of a registered function called for start-up.
String

[null]

syncFlowInit
Calls a trigger for synchronous flows instead of the registered

function (rFInit).

String

[null]

newDocVersFct
Standard ELO function Create new version to upload new

version of existing document entries.

Boolean

[false]

saveDocFct Standard ELO function Save document to download documents.
Boolean

[false]

gotoFct Go to function to open the entry in the ELO Java Client.
Boolean

Name Explanation
Type

[default]

gotoURL

Uses any URL as the target for the goto function. The query

parameter guid with the ELO GUID of the current entry is

appended to the URL. Can be used to open an ELO Integration

Client in a new window, for example.

(This function is available with ELOwf versions 12.07, 21.07,

and 20.00 and higher)

String

[null]

useJcHAIGoto

Uses the ELO Java Client HTTP Automation Interface to execute

the goto function. The ELO Web Client URL and the goto URL

must not be set. The add-on module for ELO Integration Client

support available on install.myelo.net is also required in the

ELO Java Client. When the ELO Java Client starts, the port of

the ELO HTTP Automation Interface is buffered and called for

the ELO Integration Client goto. The goto only works if the add-

on module is installed, the ELO Java Client is already running,

and a user is logged on. In addition, the same ELO user has to

be used in the ELO Integration Client and the ELO Java Client.

In restricted environments, such as Microsoft Teams, abas ERP,

or SAP Business One), this enables users to go from the ELO

Integration Client to the ELO Java Client.

(This function is available with ELOwf versions 20.14,

23.00.004, and 23.02.000 and higher)

Boolean

[false]

removeEntryFct Standard ELO function Delete to delete an entry.
Boolean

[false]

editInOfficeFct
Standard ELO function Edit in Office to edit an Office document

using the local Office applications.

Boolean

[false]

removeEntryFct Standard ELO function Delete to delete an entry.
Boolean

[false]

startWorkflowFct Standard ELO function Start workflow to start a workflow.
Boolean

[false]

startWorkflowTemplates

List of workflow templates available for an active 

startWorkflowFct. The configuration is an array of objects with

the ID and Name properties of the template.

Array

[null]

externalLinkFct
Standard ELO function Create external link for creating a

download link for external users.

Boolean

[false]

folderMask
Folder form for enabling the Create folder function. Only

folders with the configured metadata form are created.

String

[null]

documentMask
Document form for enabling the Insert file function. Only files

with this metadata form are filed.

String

[null]

4 ELO Integration Client



Name Explanation
Type

[default]

hasSearch

Enables the option to search the entire repository. The results

are listed. Note: Only certain functions are available within the

search. If the form, feed, or configured ELO apps are enabled,

entries within the search can still be edited, provided the user

has the corresponding rights.

Boolean

[false]

referenceEntryFct Enables entries from the search to be referenced.
Boolean

[false]

refreshFct Allows you to refresh the current entry.
Boolean

[false]

Information

Functions that are not configured are hidden. This does not prohibit the function from being

used. To prevent a function from being used, you have to withdraw the users' permissions to

the entry.

5 ELO Integration Client



Start-up 

Opening the client requires certain parameters that help the client load its configuration. The client

goes through a specific start-up procedure to enable the most flexible configuration possible.

URL parameters 

The client responds to the following URL parameters (besides the standard parameters of an ELO

app):

system=<system ID>: This parameter specifies the system the client has been integrated

into. Each client call requires this parameter. The value of this parameter is arbitrary, but an

entry must be made for this value in the configuration.

GUID=<GUID of the root entry>: [optional] This parameter indicates which entry should be

used as the root entry. A GUID has to be entered; an object ID is not permitted.

key=<group name of a field in the metadata>&value=<value of the field>: [optional]

Instead of using a GUID from the parameter as a root entry, you can also perform a search

for a field value (in the metadata) to find the root entry. An invoice with a specific invoice

number could serve as a root entry as an example.

In addition to these parameters, you can pass other processing parameters in an RF in the URL.

These are then used later on during start-up.

Default configuration 

The default configuration applies when starting the client. If a GUID parameter has been entered,

this GUID is applied to the configuration.

Repository configuration 

The client loads its ELO app repository configuration (elo.integration.Client.json) from the

repository (under //Administration//ELO Apps//Configuration//). It contains a configuration for all

relevant system parameters. It is used depending on the value of the system parameter (system)

and overrides the values from the default configuration (including any GUID parameter). If the

repository configuration does not contain a value, the previous value is retained.

Registered function 

If the value rFInit is set after reading the repository configuration, a registered function with this

name is called. The registered function receives all URL parameters allowing additional parameters

to be processed here, depending on the integration system. This call expects a configuration object

that overrides the previous configuration value.

For example, a registered function could:

Show/enable different functions depending on the user.

Perform a repository search to determine the root entry as GUID.

6 ELO Integration Client



Initiate a process that creates a new structure that will then be used as the root entry.

Flows trigger 

You have the option to specify a flows trigger instead of a registered function. If you use a flows

trigger, you cannot specify a registered function. ELO Flows must be installed and there must be a

component with a corresponding trigger (synchronous trigger with result). You can store the path

from the ELO Flows configuration here. It is possible to execute a trigger with multiple flows

(automations) or a specific flow configured as a data query.

Examples

Automations:

"syncFlowInit": "api/v1/trigger/com.elo.bi.flows.component/IntegrationServiceSf/1.0/

IcCallSf"

Data queries:

"syncFlowInit": "api/v1/trigger/com.elo.bi.flows.component/IntegrationServiceSf/1.0/

IcCallSf?trigger=86696b32-a734-4aa9-9351-4d41d637b5b3"

Index search 

If no GUID was set for the root entry during the previous start-up and if the URL parameters key

and value exist, a search for the specified value (value) is performed in a field (from the metadata)

with the group name (key) and the first result is used as the root entry.

Initialization 

The client loads the root entry, builds the function menu, and shows the entry; the client is then

operational for the user. This concludes the start-up process.

Known issues 

Bootstrap Glyphicons 

The integrated Internet Explorer in Navision 2015 was unable to load the font for the Bootstrap

Glyphicons in some cases. The icons are not shown.

SameSite flag 

If the ELO Integration Client is embedded in an external website (e.g. during the integration of

Salesforce, SmartWe, or Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central), you will encounter the

following problem:

With versions 80+ of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, the default handling of the SameSite

cookie has changed from none to lax.

SameSite:

The SameSite flag indicates whether a cookie is attached to a request if it is integrated in an 

iFrame that is not on the same server.

The settings are as follows:

None: Cookies are always attached (only works if the secure flag is also set)

Lax: Cookies are only attached to GET requests or if the servers are the same

Strict: Cookies are only attached if the servers are the same

Cookies are required for the ELOix connection (which executes post requests). We therefore

encounter this problem if an ELOix connection is made in an iFrame that is not on the same ELO

server. In this case, the ELO Integration Client will not load, or the loading indicator will stop:

This also affects ELOauth since cookies are also required here.

9 ELO Integration Client



The ELO Salesforce integration and other integration solutions that have a browser-based

third-party system meets these criteria.

Solution 

Requirements:

ELO must be accessible using HTTPS, and you must either be able to operate the system with a

certificate signed by a trusted authority or import a self-signed certificate in all clients. This also

sets the secure flag on the cookies. This option is only available starting with Apache Tomcat 9.0.21

and 8.5.42.

Method:

Stop the ELO Application Server (Apache Tomcat).

In Apache Tomcat, configure the context of the web application (here: the ELO Indexserver)

so that the SameSite property is set on the session cookie: The XML File to be configured is

located in the following example path: E:\ELOprofessional\servers\ELO-

<Server>\conf\Catalina\localhost\ix-<Repository>.xml

Configuration file example:

In the ELO installation directory, delete the deployment folder of the respective application

(example: E:\ELOprofessional\servers\ELO-<Server>\webapps\ix-<Repository>)

Restart the ELO Application Server.
