Manage levels

Levels – General 

ELO Digital Office GmbH plans on delivering base packages for packages with metadata and forms

gen. 2 in the future. The base package contains standardized package items. You can customize

this base standard and expand it with additional levels. Specific inheritance strategies in the base

packages allow ELO to install updates easily.

Levels are a concept for configuring modifications, e.g. between test systems/production systems

or for customer-specific topics. The respective levels are always created in a specified package.

Example 

A partner uses a custom level in an ELO solution package to make a series of modifications for a

customer. If there is an update for the ELO solution, it can be installed without difficulty because

the ELO export package only contains the base level and only replaces this when imported. The

custom level remains untouched in the customer system along with all custom modifications.

Level structure 

Each package has a base level with standard ELO elements. You can also add more levels and

customize them.

8 ELO packages



The respective levels are executed hierarchically. The levels are assigned integer values which

determine their position in the hierarchy.

Configuration 

The highest associated level available is always used for a configuration.

To allow you to overwrite the configurations as required, these must be split up into suitable

objects. This applies especially to configurations in the Config service, e.g. the views of forms or

the configurations of workspaces. 

There are initially no plans to allow for the overwriting of individual configurations in data managed

by the ELO Indexserver. Only additional complete objects can be added on higher levels here

(metadata forms, aspects, font colors, users…). The inheritance function provides an option for

modifying metadata forms.

Example 

In contract management, there is a setting for when a user should be notified of an upcoming

automatic extension of a rental contract with a set duration (e.g. cell phone contract). The default

setting (Level 100/Base) is 30 days. For a customer with slower business processes, the partner can

set a value of 60 days in the level 500/Custom.

When the system later creates the scheduled notifications, it sees the value 60 since it is in the

higher level, and the customer-side user receives the notification 60 days before the extension of

the contract.

In the Level drop-down menu, select a level.

Enter a name for the new level in the Name field.

Click Apply to confirm the change.

Level metadata 

Level:

An integer value indicates the level. The values currently in use are 100, 500, 900 (see

below). The higher the number, the higher the level, which effectively hides similar settings

of the lower levels.

Name:

The name (DisplayName) shows the level in the package overview. Full Unicode is allowed

except for pilcrows.

Example 

For the customer XYZ Inc. the overseeing partner creates a Custom level (level 500) in the 

ELOinvoice package. They name it XYZ Inc..

The following levels are currently planned: 

Name Level Examples

Base 100 ELO standard metadata forms; ELOinvoice solution

Custom 500 Sample company

Staging 900 Paths in the test system; paths in the production system

Assign content to a new level 

Click in the level display to select the level you would like to edit.

To add metadata forms, aspects, groups, keyword lists, workspace types, teamspace

Alternative: Select the desired menu item in the menu bar.

The selected menu item opens automatically, and you can generate new contents (e.g. add

metadata forms). You can find more information about what to do next in the corresponding

documentation for the menu items.
