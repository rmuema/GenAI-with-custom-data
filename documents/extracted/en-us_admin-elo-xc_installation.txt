Installation

System requirements 

ELO XC requires an ELO server that is currently supported. You will find the version number in the 

ELOxcVersion.txt version history.

ELO XC must be installed on one of these systems:

Microsoft Windows Server 2016

Microsoft Windows Server 2019

Microsoft Windows Server 2022

These Exchange servers are supported:

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 SP1

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016

Microsoft Exchange Server 2019

Microsoft Exchange Online (Microsoft 365)

Local authentication (on-premises) is done using basic authentication for LDAP and EWS.

Authentication with Microsoft 365 (cloud) is done using an app registration (Modern Authentication

OAuth 2.0). This also requires the following installations:

Windows Management Framework 5.1

Microsoft PowerShell 5 (possibly Microsoft PowerShell 7 as well)

Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module

The integrated configuration interface ELO XC Manager is supported by the following browsers:

Current version of Microsoft Edge

Current version of Google Chrome

Current version of Mozilla Firefox

Up to four certificates may be required on the ELO XC system, which must be available in the

system's certificate store:

Source Meaning/Requirement

Z1 ELO server (Tomcat certificate) SSL connections to Indexserver

Z2 EWS (Exchange certificate) SSL connection to EWS

Z3 ELO XC Integrated web host for ELO XC Manager

Z4 ELO XC App registration in Microsoft 365 tenant

Installation details

ELO server certificate 

If you are using Windows Server 2016, you may need to make adjustments in the registry to use

the SSL server certificate. We recommend using at least Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. For

information on how to configure the TLS version for Windows systems, refer to the Microsoft

documentation.

The Tomcat server.xml file should look like this:

<Connector

    SSLEnabled="true"

    ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,

        TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,

        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,

        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,

        TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,

        TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,

        TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,

        TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,

        TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,

        TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,

        TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"

    clientAuth="false"

    keystoreFile="C:\keystore.jks"

    keystorePass="aaa"

    maxHttpHeaderSize="65536"

7 ELO XC



The keystoreFile, keystorePass, and port properties must be adapted to the respective server

installation. Make sure that you enter the cipher suites TLSECDHERSAWITHAES256GCMSHA384*

and TLSECDHERSAWITHAES128GCMSHA256*. If you make changes in the server.xml, you have to

restart the ELO server.

If you have activated the correct TLS version in the system, configured the server.xml as described,

and ELO XC still cannot establish an SSL connection to the Indexserver, you can try removing the 

ciphers property from server.xml.

If this also fails, you can still try to enter TLS version 1.1 as well:

PowerShell cmdlets 

Please note

The following PowerShell cmdlets illustrate what needs to be done to establish a successful

PowerShell connection to Microsoft 365 Exchange Online. You can find the complete

documentation and help for troubleshooting issues on the Microsoft website. In particular,

the examples used here may not be as complete or up-to-date as the current software.

Certificates 

When generating a self-signed certificate, you should copy the fingerprint from PowerShell and save

it separately for use in other cmdlets or the ELO XC configuration.

This is how you create a certificate:

    maxThreads="1000"

    port="9093"

    protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"

    scheme="https"

    secure="true"

    sslEnabledProtocols="+TLSv1.2,+TLSv1.3"

/>

sslEnabledProtocols="+TLSv1.1,+TLSv1.2,+TLSv1.3"

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "dns.name" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter 

8 ELO XC



The DnsName parameter must not contain any wildcards. The ELO XC host certificate (Z3) requires

the local fully qualified domain name (FQDN), whereas the app registration certificate (Z4) requires

the Microsoft 365 tenant name. We recommend that you always save the fingerprint of new

certificates.

In this example, 0C202737F8B809FAFA532C61E878F8DEEB385787 was used for Z3 and 

2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974 was used for Z4. Since Z4 is required for app

registration in Microsoft 365, you need to export it as CER file without private key:

If you want to use the same certificate for the ELO XC web host and the app registration (Z3=Z4),

generate the certificate with two values for DnsName.

In this case, you would need a new fingerprint (here: 9428F14E2E9A50DEC74D8EFD9D95DB5C3602F38D).

You can check the DNS name in the local certificate store:

$cert = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974

$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath C:\XcAppReg.cer

9 ELO XC



Install module for Exchange Online 

The PowerShell examples assume that the user has administrative privileges. Run PowerShell as

administrator. Use at least PowerShell version 5.1. If necessary, update the local PowerShell

version.

This is how to check the local PowerShell version:

Most cmdlets require external calls. In particular, the connection to Exchange Online must be

enabled for remote PowerShell access. To install missing modules and the PackageProvider, you

may be required to change the TSL version:

$PSVersionTable

::SecurityProtocol = ::Tls12[Net.ServicePointManager] [Net.SecurityProtocolType]

10 ELO XC



To allow remote PowerShell access, you need to enable this function:

You should only run signed external cmdlets and scripts. You need to confirm the start of the

execution manually:

First, you can check whether the Exchange Online module (ExchangeOnlineManagement module) is

available locally:

If it is missing, you must download and install it. First install the PackageProvider for NuGet and

import it. Afterwards, you need the PowerShellGet module.

This is how to install and import the PackageProvider:

Enable-PSRemoting

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Get-Module

Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force

Import-PackageProvider -Name NuGet

11 ELO XC



This is how to install the PowerShellGet module:

Now you can install and import the module for Exchange Online:

Install-Module PowershellGet -Force

Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope AllUsers

Import-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement

12 ELO XC



Please note

The module for Exchange Online must be installed for all users, because the ELO XC service

is usually registered with its own account or the system account, but the module is installed

with a different account.

Test module for Exchange Online

If the module for Exchange Online is installed, ELO XC imports it automatically at runtime. If the

import is successful, the connection to Exchange Online can be established. Once you have set up

the app registration, you can test the PowerShell connection manually. Use the app ID and the

tenant from the registration:

Connect-ExchangeOnline -CertificateThumbPrint 2E5B4D92DFBE8CFB49CF57106534EC50B12E6974 -Organization 

13 ELO XC



Once the connection is successfully established, you can test the two required Get-Mailbox and 

Get-MailboxPermission cmdlets:

You should disconnect active PowerShell connections at the end as follows:

To prevent ELO XC from accessing specific mailboxes through the PowerShell connection, you can

use New-ApplicationAccessPolicy. This requires an active PowerShell connection:

Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails 'sharedmailbox' * | Get-MailboxPermission | where {$_.user

Disconnect-ExchangeOnline

New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId cbfafa12-36c7-4586-a9c7-f94e923f1d26 -PolicyScopeGroupId xc2@tenant

14 ELO XC



Please note

After a successful test, the Exchange Online module may fail to load in some environments.

If you check the MainCatalog log, you will see a message that the Connect-ExchangeOnline

cmdlet cannot be found. In this case, you should install Microsoft PowerShell 7 in addition to

Microsoft PowerShell 5. Install the module there again.

EAC: ApplicationImpersonation 

In an on-premises installation, ELO XC requires the ApplicationImpersonation role. This role allows

the service account (XCACC) to impersonate access to mailboxes. The role needs to be assigned in

EAC (Exchange Admin Center).

15 ELO XC



App registration 

To allow ELO XC to connect to Microsoft 365 with Modern Authentication (OAuth 2.0), an app

registration in the tenant (TNNT) is required, which administratively acts as the service principal of

ELO XC and is assigned the Exchange administrator role. The app registration has an ID that is used

to recognize that external authentication has taken place. The key is a locally generated certificate

whose public key (CER file) must be added to the app registration. The API permissions of the app

registration determine which functions are available to ELO XC in Microsoft 365.

The fullaccessas_app permission allows full access to all mailboxes.

To limit access to specific Exchange Online mailboxes, you need to generate application

access policies.

The process is described here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-limit-mailbox-

access.

'Exchange administrator' role 

A ServicePrincipal is automatically created during the app registration. With the API permissions,

ELO XC is authorized to get proxy access to mailboxes and read their permission settings to find

delegates in shared mailboxes. To establish a connection with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet,

the service principal needs the Exchange administrator role.

Updating the main version 

Update paths 

ELO XC updates the configuration automatically. This includes changes to the configuration

formatted in XML due to dropped, new or renamed items or properties. 

In versions prior to ELOxc 12, this requires a separate command prompt.

From ELOxc 12 onwards, this is done automatically every time the program is started.

Up to and including ELOxc 20, all configuration versions down to and including ELOxc 9

are recognized.

As of ELO XC 21, the oldest allowed configuration version is ELOxc 11.

When switching the main version, however, changes can occur that cannot be implemented

automatically but require manual intervention. It is always advisable to check things

manually in this case.

Warning

To allow you to easily perform a rollback in the event of unexpected issues, we recommend

creating backup copies of the instance configurations in the Manager repository area before

version migration.

Upgrade ELOxc 9 to ELOxc 10 

Stop ELOxc and the Tomcat that the console is running on.

Go to the directory …\server\webapps and delete the xc-console.war file.

In the ELOxc installation directory, run the ELOxcTools.exe as administrator and delete the

ELOxc service.

Uninstall ELOxc for Microsoft EWS 9 via the Control Panel.

Delete the remaining files in the installation directory.

In the registry, rename the HKLM\Software\ELO Digital\ELOxc9 key to ELOxc.

Install ELOxc for Microsoft EWS 10.

Copy the console from the installation directory to the ...\prog\webapps directory.

Start the Tomcat.

Run ELOxcTools.exe to register the service again and insert the new license key.

Use the ELO client (Administrator) to remove the <Licenses>…</Licenses> XML element from

the SORDS extra text in the //Administration//ELOxc Base//Workspace and //Administration//

ELOxc Base//Service paths.

Run ELOxc.exe -update from the command line (Administrator).

After a few moments, check the update log file to see if it contains the line update finished

and succeeded.

Since the Keywording action was removed in ELOxc 11 and replaced by templates, all

instance configurations have to be adjusted manually.

Keywording with ELOxc 11 

In ELOxc version 11, the Keywording action was removed. Instead, keywording is stored as a

template, which makes it easier to work with ELOxc EWS in the long term.

You can quickly and easily convert existing keywording into templates.

Go to the Keywording action that is currently displayed and copy the XML contents (from line

2, the first line is created when you create the template with names).

Switch to Templates > Keywording and add the keywording with the desired name.

Then edit the XML file and insert the old XML lines.

Finally, you only need to change the last line in your XML file: Replace </KeywordingDef> with 

</TemplateKeywordingDef> and remove the slash / from the first line.

Upgrade ELOxc 12 to ELOxc 20 

Set all instances to idle processing mode so that when ELOxc 20 is started for the first time,

the program will not start processing without prior validation.

The catalog type ews no longer exists in ELOxc 20. Replace it with a PowerShell or Azure

catalog and test the affected instances.

Stop ELOxc 12.

Remove the old service registration with eloxc.exe -uninstall.

Delete all ELOxc 12 files other than ELOxc.xml from the installation directory.

Extract all ELOxc 20 files to the installation directory.

Register ELOxc 20 with eloxc.exe -install -logdir:<logdir> -port:<port> -

cert:<certificate>

Start ELOxc 20.

The configuration updates are performed automatically the first time you start the program.

Validate the instances again. Check for possible validation errors, especially:

a. Consolidate deleted collective folders

b. Consolidate path types

c. Consolidate stubbing

Publish the validated instance configurations.

Restart ELOxc 20.

Incorrect validation of instances 

Validate each instance. In some cases, error messages are expected that you need to correct

manually in the instance configuration:

Removal of collective folders 

Due to the removal of collective folders (when extracting attachments) and the changes in

associated options for entering metadata, the pseudo-property EloSplitFolderGuid needs to be

removed manually if used. You can simulate the mechanism for using collective folders by making

simple configuration additions in ArcPathDef. However, a GUID for these folders is no longer

available.

29 ELO XC



Introduction of path types 

By introducing path types, all paths are marked as main paths, which violates the rule that there

can only be one main path for each ArcPathDef action. All paths starting from the second one must

be manually configured as paths for logical references as this is how they were used in ELOxc 12.

Stubbing 

If you skeletonize messages (StubbingDef and TemplateStubDef), you have to change the action

and the template, because the variables in TemplateStubDef have changed significantly. In

addition, a template now requires you to specify both template types: HTML and text. This enables

you to use a template for both message body types.

Upgrade ELOxc 20 to ELO XC 21 

The minimum version for automatic updates is ELOxc 11. Older versions must be migrated to

an ELOxc 11 version or newer.

In ELO XC 21, the instance configurations distributed to SORDS extra text are combined in an

XML file. We therefore recommend that you create a backup of the ELOxc 20 configuration

structure.

PowerShell catalogs can no longer be used with basic authentication, but require the 

Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module and an app registration.

Change the Cert property in the ELOxc.xml file. The property value must be the certificate

fingerprint. A TP= prefix or even CN= is no longer needed and must be removed.

Stop ELOxc 20.

If necessary, remove the old service registration with eloxc.exe -uninstall.

Delete all ELOxc 20 files other than ELOxc.xml from the installation directory.

Extract all ELO XC 21 files to the installation directory.

Register ELO XC 21 with eloxc.exe -install -logdir:<logdir> -port:<port> -

cert:<certificate>

Start ELOxc 20.

Check the main log of each instance for configuration errors.

Log on to ELO XC Manager and change/validate the instance configurations if necessary.
