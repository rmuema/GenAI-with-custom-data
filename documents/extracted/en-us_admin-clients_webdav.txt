WebDAV

ELO WebDAV server address 

Information

ELO WebDAV is already integrated into the ELO Indexserver. You can access the ELO WebDAV

directory from the browser. To do this, enter the ELO WebDAV address according to the

following convention:

Connecting using a fully qualified domain name 

If you want to connect to a WebDAV server using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), you must

add the server to the corresponding Local intranet zone:

Open the Internet Options in the Control Panel.

Navigate to the Security tab.

Click Sites.

Fig.: Edit 'Local intranet' zone

The Local intranet dialog box opens.

The Automatically detect intranet network setting must be enabled.

Click Advanced.

Using ELO WebDAV in Windows 

Windows uses NTLM authentication. This means that passwords are only transferred to the server

in encrypted form.

General note on using ELO WebDAV in Windows 

This section contains notes on using ELO WebDAV in Windows.

WebDAV Redirector 

In Windows Server 2016 and higher, you must install the WebDAV Redirector component server

side.

You can find more information below under Using WebDAV Redirector.

WebClient 

The Windows service WebClient must be running on the client computers. Ideally, the service

should be set to start automatically.

You can set the startup type with the following PowerShell command:

You can start the service with the following PowerShell command:

Data transfer rate 

With the default settings, a maximum of 47 MB can be transferred using WebDAV.

To enable a greater transmission rate, adjust the FileSizeLimitInBytes key in the registry.

You can find the key under:

Here you can enter values up to 4 GB (4294967295 bytes).

Next, restart the ELO Web Client service for the changes to take effect.

Path length 

The maximum path length in Windows is 260 characters.

Connecting Windows Explorer as a network drive (Windows Vista and

newer) 

To connect ELO WebDAV as a network drive in Windows (Vista or higher), first open Windows

Explorer and right-click Computer or Network.

Select Map network drive from the context menu.

Fig.: Connecting to a network drive in Windows

Select a free drive letter and enter the address of your ELO WebDAV under Folder.

Click Finish.

6 Client administration



Fig.: Logon without Active Directory

If the user logged into Windows is in Active Directory and exists as a user in ELO, NTLM

authentication is applied automatically and no logon information needs to be entered. Otherwise,

the Windows Security dialog box asks for your user name and password. Authenticate using your

ELO user data.

Please note

In this case, the basic authentication procedure is used, and the password is sent to the

server in plain text. You can secure the data transfer using SSL.

In the registry, change the value of the BasicAuthLevel key to "2" (decimal) accordingly. You

can find the key under:

Please note

Copying documents clears the metadata.

This is because the Explorer sends the PUT command with the target path and content to

ELOix, making it impossible to determine the SORD of the content since there is no SORD

ID.

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters

Slow connection to the WebDAV drive 

If the connection to the WebDAV drive and Windows Vista is slow, check the following:

Open the Internet Options in the Control Panel.

Navigate to the Connections tab.

Click LAN settings.

Fig.: Editing the option for local network settings

The Local Area Network (LAN) Settings dialog box opens.

Select the preferred drive letter and click the link to Sign up for online storage or connect to a

network server.

The Windows wizard to add network resources starts. Click Next to continue.

Select Choose a different network resource and click Next.

Enter the ELO WebDAV address and click Next.

8 Client administration



Enter a name for the network address.

Click Finish.

Using WebDAV Redirector 

Windows Server 2016 and higher 

In Windows Server 2016 and higher, you must install the WebDAV Redirector component server

side.

Install as follows:

Use the following PowerShell command:

Check the status of the installation with the following PowerShell command:

Fig.: Successfully installed

If WebDAV Redirector was successfully installed, the value Installed is output in the table.

Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2012):

http://www.iis.net/learn/publish/using-webdav/using-the-webdav-redirector

Information

Desktop Experience must be installed starting with version 2008.

If you get the error message "System error 67 has occurred. The network name cannot

be found" when adding the ELO WebDAV as a network drive, please check whether the

Windows WebClient service is running and whether Desktop Experience is installed.

With the command line 

To map ELO WebDAV to a network drive, use the following command in the Windows command

line:

Use the /persistent parameter to define whether the network drive should remain available after a

restart. If you set the value no here, the connection will not be reestablished.

With NetDrive 

Fig.: Access via NetDrive

Click New Site and enter a name for the connection.

Enter the ELO WebDAV address under Site IP or URL.

Open the drop-down menu for Server Type and select the entry WebDav.

Enter the server port into the Port field.

Select the drive letter you want to use.

net use Z: \\<host name>:<port>/ix-<repository name>/ixwebdav/persistent:yes

10 Client administration



Enter your ELO logon credentials under Account and Password.

To activate SSL encryption, click Advanced and select Use HTTPS.

To use SSL encryption, change the port from 8080 to 443.

Click Save to save the connection.

Click Connect to establish the connection.

With BitKinex 

Fig.: Access via BitKinex

Unlike Windows Explorer and NetDrive, BitKinex does not support WebDAV connections as network

drives. Instead, it uses its own interface. However, BitKinex does support a wide range of features

including the ability to lock folders and files and move and copy files on the server without having

to download the files first.

To connect BitKinex to ELO WebDAV, click Connect or Quick Connect under the File menu option.

Enter the ELO WebDAV Internet address and the ELO user data.

Now click Connect.

11 Client administration



Using WebDAV with Microsoft Office applications 

Fig.: WebDAV connection via Microsoft Word

Microsoft Office uses its own WebDAV client. This means you can open an ELO repository in Office

applications like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint without connecting ELO

WebDAV to a network drive first.

In the Open dialog box, enter the Internet address as file name and confirm your input by pressing

the Enter key.

Please note

Do not click OK.

General note on using ELO WebDAV with Microsoft Office applications 

With the default settings, some Microsoft Office programs only open documents from a hyperlink in

read-only mode. In the registry, change the value of the OpenDocumentsReadWriteWhileBrowsing key

to "1" (DWORD) accordingly.

You can find the key under:

The following website provides instructions: http://www.webdavsystem.com/server/documentation/

ms_office_read_only.

http://www.webdavsystem.com/server/documentation/ms_office_read_only
http://www.webdavsystem.com/server/documentation/ms_office_read_only


If a logon dialog box is shown every time you open Office documents, the following settings have

to be changed.

Enable the option Automatic logon with current user name and password (found under: 

Internet Options > Security > Local Intranet > Custom Level > User authentication > Logon)

The ELOix server must be in the intranet zone. This requires two entries:

One with FQN: (e.g.: http://srvtdev.elo.local)

One without FQN: (e.g.: http://srvtdev.elo.local)

In the Windows registry, create the entry (REG_MULTI_SZ) with the name 

AuthForwardServerList under:

As the value, use the host name of the IX server.

This requires two entries:

One with FQN: (e.g.: http://srvtdev.elo.local)

One without FQN: (e.g.: http://srvtdev.elo.local)

Embedding ELO objects in Microsoft Office applications

Using WebDAV on Linux 

NTLM authentication is not used on Linux. Instead, Linux uses basic authentication. For this reason,

we recommend that you secure the data transfer through SSL.

Davfs2 (command line) 

Use the following command:

Replace the placeholders with your own values.

Gnome/Nautilus 

Fig.: Configuration in Nautilus

In Nautilus, click Locations > Connect to server, or click File >Connect with a server.

KDE/Dolphin 

Open the ELO WebDAV address with Dolphin or Konqueror.

sudo mount.davfs –o userid=<LINUX-USER> http://<server name>:<port>/ix-<repository name>/ixwebdav/mnt/

14 Client administration



Using WebDAV on MAC OS X 

NTLM authentication is not used on Mac OS X. Instead, Linux uses basic authentication. For this

reason, we recommend that you secure the data transfer through SSL.

Command line 

Use the following command:

Finder 

In the Finder, click Go to > Connect to server.

Enter the Internet address of ELO WebDAV into Server address.

Click Connect.

Information

While working with the Finder, many temporary files will be generated, uploaded to ELO,

and deleted again afterwards. Additionally, the files are also created in the ELO root folder.

For this reason, the user who is logged on must have write permissions to the root folder.

Cyberduck 

Unlike the Finder, the free Cyberduck tool does not generate temporary files.

After installing Cyberduck, start Cyberduck from your dock or program folder. Click New connection.

mount -t webdav http://<server name>:<port>/ix-<repository name>/ixwebdav/<mount point >
