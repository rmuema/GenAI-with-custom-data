Introduction 

Structure of the documentation 

The goal of this documentation is to explain all functions of Business Solution ELO Meeting

Premium.

Basics 

The Basics chapter explains the basics of the ELO Meeting Premium program interface.

Possible actions 

The remaining chapters address possible actions using ELO Meeting Premium.

Target audience 

This documentation is addressed to Business Solution ELO Meeting Premium users. Separate

documentation is available for administrators on the ELO SupportWeb.

The scope of functions presented in this documentation may differ greatly from those in your

client.

If you do not find functions described in this documentation in your client, you do not have

permission to perform the action.

Roles 

The documentation structure is based on the roles that are required in connection with meetings:

Role Meaning

Board

manager

The only task board managers have is to create meeting boards. Board managers

are not authorized to perform other functions.

Board

organizers

Board organizers are authorized for all functions within their board. However, they

cannot create meeting boards.

Item

submitters

Item submitters have access to all functions relating to items, e.g. New item and 

Create proposal. People who create and prepare items do not have to be members or

guests of a meeting board.

Members

and guests

Members are people who attend all meetings in this meeting board. Guests are

additionally created for individual meetings. Members and guests are authorized to

view the meeting and its contents. Depending on the setting, they may also be

authorized to create items. Members and guests can participate in voting and be

assigned tasks to work on.

3 Business Solution ELO Meeting Premium



Role Meaning

Minute

Only minute takers and organizers are authorized to write minutes. Minutes takers

are authorized to view the meeting and its contents even if they are not a member

or guest. However, they are only granted this permission once the meeting starts.

4 Business Solution ELO Meeting Premium



Basics 

Basic principle 

Business Solution ELO Meeting Premium provides optimal support in planning, carrying out, and

following up on meetings.

Departments can jointly prepare items for meetings. All relevant information and decisions are

documented during the meeting, and minutes are created after the meeting.

A meeting board provides a framework for all meetings, which means that general information,

such as members or recurring items, only needs to be entered once.

ELO Meeting Premium features an integrated app:

The calendar function allows users to join meetings they are authorized to attend.

The app maps the entire meeting process. The scope of functions differs depending on what

your role is in a meeting. If you are the meeting organizer, you can plan meetings in the app,

for example. Or if you are a member of a meeting board, you can view the agenda ahead of

a meeting and take part in voting during meetings.

General note 

ELO Meeting works with the following clients:

Meeting board

Introduction 

A meeting board is an area in which all meetings held by a committee or other body are created.

When you create a meeting board, you enter information that is inherited by all meetings within

this meeting board, such as members and recurring items.

Information

To avoid meeting boards being created unnecessarily, only a few people are authorized to

create meeting boards.

Permissions 

Meeting boards do not inherit the permissions of the folder that they are created in. This means

that people can be authorized for a meeting board but not have permission to access the folder

that the meeting board is stored in. Therefore, if you are a member of a meeting board and you do

not have access to the folder containing the meeting board, you will not be able to access the

meeting board from the Repository work area.

In this case, you have the following options:

Meeting calendar: You can see all your meetings in the calendar.

Search: You can access the meeting board using the search function.

Link: You receive an e-mail with the link to the meeting board or meeting.

There is also the option to display a QR code during a meeting. This takes participants to the

respective meeting and not to the meeting board.

The following list contains the permissions for a meeting board:

Board manager

Only board managers are authorized to create meeting boards.

Creating meeting boards is the only task that board managers have unless they are granted

other permissions.

Organizer

Organizers are selected by the board manager when they are creating a meeting board.

It is possible to appoint multiple organizers for each meeting board.

Meeting board organizers can select other organizers.

There is only one function that is not available to organizers: New meeting board.

It is possible to change the minute taker for individual meetings.

Minute takers are authorized to write minutes.

If a minute taker is not a member of the meeting board, they are not granted access to the

meeting board. They are granted access once the meeting has started.

Elements of a meeting board 

Each meeting board features a calendar (Meeting board tab), a form, contents, and a feed.

'Meeting board' tab 

You will find the meeting board calendar on the Meeting board tab. This calendar displays all

meetings within the meeting board.

For more information, refer to the Meeting board calendar chapter.

or just for individual meetings within the meeting board. Refer to the Create notification

template chapter to learn how to create notification templates. To find out how to use

notification templates, refer to the Create meeting board chapter.

Members: This folder contains all active and inactive members of the meeting board. They

are automatically inherited by meetings within the meeting board but can be removed from

individual meetings.

Create meeting board 

Information

This chapter is aimed at board managers. If you need a meeting board and do not have the

necessary permissions, contact a board manager at your company.

A meeting board provides the framework for all meetings. You need to create a meeting board in

order to be able to create meetings.

When you create a meeting board, you enter information that does not change during the meeting

series, such as members and notifications. This information is inherited by all meetings within the

meeting board and therefore only needs to be entered once.

Once a meeting board has been created, the organizers can edit it.

Requirements

You are a board manager.

You cannot create meeting boards with existing meeting boards, item pools, or items.

Method

In the Repository work area, select the folder you want to create the meeting board in.

On the ribbon, go to the New tab and select Meeting > New meeting board.

34 Business Solution ELO Meeting Premium



Meetings

Introduction 

Each meeting is part of a meeting board. Without a meeting board, therefore, you cannot create

meetings.

You see the meetings that you are authorized to attend. The functions that are available to you in a

meeting depend on your role in that meeting.

Permissions 

Since most meeting permissions are based on the permissions of a meeting board, they correspond

to the meeting board permissions. For more information, refer to the Permissions chapter in the

section on meeting boards.

You can also add guests to individual meetings.

Guest

Guests are authorized to access individual meetings within the meeting board.

Since guests do not have meeting board permissions, they cannot navigate to the meeting

from the Repository work area.

Elements of a meeting 

Each meeting has a meeting app ('Meeting' tab), a form, contents, and a feed.

Information

If you have been given a direct link to the standalone app, you go straight to the meeting

Prepare item 

You can create items to be discussed during a meeting. An item can either be created in a meeting

directly or in an item pool.

Information

You can create items for a meeting board even if you are not a member. In this case, you

need to create the item in a item pool. Someone with the appropriate permissions must

move it to the meeting board for you. For example, if you prepare an item for your

supervisor (member of the meeting board), enter this person in the Responsible field. This

means that your supervisor is authorized for both the agenda item and the meeting board

and can register and submit the agenda item.

You then edit the item by adding documents or a proposal, for example.

If the item is in a item pool, you still have to register it for a meeting and/or submit it. The

difference is that only you can view the contents of a registered item. As soon as you submit your

item, the contents can be viewed by other members and organizers. This allows you to announce

an item of business and schedule it for the agenda.
