ELO Web Client for administrators

Basics 

Target audience 

This document is addressed to ELO Web Client administrators.

Separate documentation is available for users explaining how the ELO Web Client works.

Requirements and installation 

Web archive 

The ELO Web Client consists of a web archive (.war) that is deployed on an Apache Tomcat server.

The ELO Web Client must be installed individually for each repository that is managed through a

separate ELO Indexserver.

ELO Server/Tomcat 

To enable parameter transfer with special characters, the /conf/server.xml file must have the entry 

URIEncoding=“UTF-8“ in the Connector section of the ELO server/Tomcat.

Example

Browser 

The ELO Web Client runs as a web application in a browser. As an HTML5 application, the ELO Web

Client requires a current browser. The browser must support the latest HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

standards.

Information

Configure the browser to allow cookies and enable JavaScript.

The System requirements contains information about which browsers are currently supported.

Though the ELO Web Client is generally supported by older browser versions, we recommended

using the latest versions for better performance.

Information

<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8

When using Internet Explorer, icons may not load correctly. In this case, the default icons are

displayed instead.

ELO Indexserver access 

The ELO Indexserver must be directly available for the browser (see section ELO Web Client

Internet Access).

Single sign-on 

The single sign-on (SSO) function is run automatically via the ELO Indexserver. You do not need to

configure this in the ELO Web Client.

Installation 

The ELO Web Client installed using the ELO Server Setup (see separate documentation).

ELO Web Client Internet Access 

To work with the ELO Web Client both via the intranet and the Internet, ELO Web Client Internet

Access has to be configured accordingly.

Refer to the separate section for information on the configuration of ELO Web Client internet

access.

Starting the program 

The ELO Web Client offers a number of options to start the program.

For more information on starting the program for the first time, refer to the Start pages and entry

points chapter.

Manual logon 

Manual logon does not require additional settings. You access the manual logon page via a URL

with the following format:

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/

Administration 

This chapter contains information on administrative tasks in the ELO Web Client.

Configuration 

You can make a number of settings on the configuration page of the ELO Web Client.

You can access the configuration via User menu [your name] > Configuration.

Categories 

The settings on the configuration page are divided into categories. When you open a category, you

see the settings of the selected category. The settings are grouped by topic within the category.

You will find an i with additional information next to each setting.

Configuration sets 

The different settings are separated into groups. These groups are called configuration sets.

As the main ELO administrator, you have the right to manage all configuration sets. You can assign

configuration sets to or remove them from users and option groups.

Information

Each user only sees the settings that were assigned to them via the configuration sets. Only

you will see the sets themselves.

The following configuration sets exist:

• 

5 Client administration



Red circle: Refers to administrative settings that have a significant impact. This set should be

restricted to administrators.

Blue circle: Refers to the settings that have a significant impact.

Green circle: Refers to settings that do not have a significant impact.

Next to each setting, you will see which set they belong to.

Assign configuration sets

To assign a user or group a configuration set, proceed as follows:

Click Select user and select the user or the group.

Click the Configuration sets category and select the desired configuration sets.

The changes are saved automatically.

Who do these settings apply for? 

First, you need to select who you want to change the settings for. The following modes are

available:

My configuration: All settings only apply to your own account. The configuration opens in this mode.

Create configuration for user/group: The settings apply for a certain user or users in an option

group. To select this mode, click the Select user button and choose a user or an option group.

Please note

Option groups cannot be used to transfer permissions.

Create global configuration: The settings apply for all users. To select this mode, click the Select

user button and choose Everyone.

Important

When you have changed a setting, leave the check box to the far left selected. If you clear

the check box, the ELO Web Client restores the default settings.

Apply ribbon settings 

This function enables you to apply the functions of the ribbon for another user or another option

group.

Click Select user and select the user or the group you want to apply the ribbon settings for.

Click Apply ribbon settings. Here, select the user or group whose ribbon settings you want to

apply.

The functions on the ribbon of the two users/groups are now identical.

Inheritance hierarchy of the settings 

The ELO Web Client verifies which settings apply for which user at three levels. If there is an

individual setting for a user, ELO uses this setting. If there are no individual settings for a user, the

ELO Web Client checks whether the user is a member of an option group. If this is the case, the

settings of the option group apply. The default values apply if no settings have been configured.

Custom user settings: This item only appears if you create a configuration for an option group. Use

the Remove custom settings button to make sure that all users of an option group have indeed

been assigned the same settings.

1.

7 Client administration



Please note

The Remove custom settings action is required if the members of an option group have

previously had access to certain settings. If you now remove a configuration set from an

option group, this option group has fewer settings to choose from. Changes made up to this

point must be overwritten once.

Home screens and entry points 

The ELO Web Client has multiple start pages and entry points. Each entry point redirects to the

respective start page. Different functions and areas are available depending on the start page.

Information

The default language is determined based on your browser's language setting. However,

you can change the language in the logon dialog box or in the start parameters.

Start pages 

Choose from the following start pages:

Main page

Direct view

Main page 

This page offers the full functionality of the ELO Web Client.

The following entry points are also available for the main page:

Manual logon 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/

Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/

You will be redirected to the logon page. You must enter your user name and password.

If logon is successful, you will be redirected to the main page of the program. If logon fails, a

corresponding error message is shown. In this case, correct your logon data and click OK.

Information

If you are logging on manually, the name you entered stays the same when you change the

language settings or log on to the system again.

8 Client administration



Alternative (start parameters possible) 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/login.html

Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/login.html

This entry point also redirects you to the logon page. You can add other start parameters to the

entry point, which will affect various settings (e.g. client language, start page, etc.).

Single sign-on (SSO) 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/sso.html

Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/sso.html

This page uses SSO to log on to the repository. If logon is successful, you will be redirected to the

main page of the ELO Web Client. Otherwise, it will revert to the manual logon page.

Alternative (start parameters possible) 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/login/index.jsp

Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/login/index.jsp

This entry point provides an alternative to SSO. You can add other start parameters to the entry

point, which will affect various settings (e.g. client language, start page, etc.).

Direct view 

This is not a start page in the conventional sense but more of an interface that you can open

documents in. This requires a GUID as an additional parameter that automatically provides the

browser with a link that refers to the document with the GUID entered. If the browser cannot

display the document, then a message or pop-up window will appear, depending on the browser

setting.

Use the following entry point for direct view:

Log on with GUID 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/guid.jsp?guid=<GUID>

Example: http://DELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/guid.jsp?

guid=(4BE6C7FB-7F13-4297-93E5-3A26AD22EFEF)

For compatibility reasons, this logon redirects you to the direct view. You also need to enter a GUID

as a parameter.

9 Client administration



Access via start parameters 

You can enter additional parameters for some logons. These parameters are attached to the URL

when called. Always separate the first parameter from the URL with an ?. All additional parameters

are separated with an &. The respective value is specified with an =.

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/ix/login.jsp

For example: http://ELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/ix/logon.jsp?locale=fr&user=Anderson

The following parameters are available:

locale: Determines the language setting for the current session. The ELO Web Client currently

supports the following languages: Danish, German, English, Finnish, French, Greek, Indonesian,

Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Serbian, Slovakian,

Spanish (International), Spanish (Latin America), Czech, Turkish, and Hungarian.

startPage: Determines the landing page that opens after logging on. The following values are

allowed: main page = 1, and direct view = 3.

GUID: GUID of a document, required for the document view and can be specified for the main page.

Enter the GUID of a document in parentheses, e.g. (9C0E2DA7-C1C6-4856-90D7-A50DA876F252).

Log on with authentication start parameters 

http://<host>:<port>/web-<repository name>/ix/urlLogin.jsp?user=<user name>&pw=<password>

Enter the parameters for the user name for this logon page (user) and password (pw). After SSO,

additional parameters are evaluated and you are then redirected to the corresponding start page.

Please note

This logon page displays the user name and password in plain text. If Secure Socket Layer

(SSL) was enabled, the parameters are encrypted but will still appear in plain text in the

browser or in the browser history. This also applies for server logs.

Settings via the ELO Application Server Manager 

Use the ELO Application Server Manager or the URL <server>:<port>/web-<repository name>/status

to call the ELO Web Client status page.

For example: http://ELOSERVER:9090/web-Repository/status

This page shows the installed client version. You can also change settings.

Configuration file 

When you install the ELO Web Client, a service account reads the configuration files. The

installation process writes the entries to the configuration file of the ELO Web Client, config.xml.

The password is encrypted.

You can also make these settings manually by entering the corresponding values for configUser

and configPwd.

Change the password for the service account 

If you changed the password for the service account, enter the changed password to configPwd.

Optional: To enter your password encrypted, use the password.bat help program from the ELO

Server Setup directory.

Please note

If you enter the password for the service account unencrypted, a message will be issued in

the log file of the ELO Web Client (example: web-arc-001.log) along with an indication of the

encrypted password. Enter the encrypted password string to the config.xml configuration file

under configPwd.

7. 

15 Client administration



Scripting API 

A scripting API was developed for the ELO Web Client to enable developers to program extensions.

The interface is currently restricted to the start page of the client.

The Web Client Scripting Base folder is located in the Administration folder of the repository.

Relevant files will be read from this folder.

If this folder is not available, you can create a Scripting Base folder on the relevant page in the

ELOprofessional Application Server Manager. Normally, the Web Client Scripting Base folder is

created when ELO is installed.

All scripting, CSS, and image files are read and loaded dynamically when a user starts the main

page of the client (if the user has sufficient rights).

Development 

Some functions have been integrated to help you work with the interface. These are explained in

the following section:

DevMode: This enables you to activate developer mode. You will need to change the relevant entry

in the settings of the ELOprofessional Application Server Manager.

In developer mode, all JavaScript files will be loaded separately when starting the main page. This

makes troubleshooting much easier. In addition, the folder dev (in the ELO installation directory

under ...\server\webapps\web-\<repository name\>\dev) is checked for additional script, CSS, and

image files. These files are integrated dynamically when starting the main page.

Please note

We do not recommend using developer mode in productive systems.

ELO Web Add-ons

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to install and configure the ELO Web Add-ons program.

ELO Web Add-ons expand or change the scope of functions of the ELO Web Client. You will find a

description of the new and changed functions in the ELO Web Client manual.

17 Client administration



Download 

You can download the ZIP file from the ELO master DVD or the ELO SupportWeb.

Content of the ZIP file:

Name Description

ELO Web Add-ons.msi Installation wizard

Setup.exe Allows you to choose the language for the installation wizard

readme.txt Brief installation instructions

*.mst These files are exclusively for selecting a language for Setup.exe

18 Client administration



Installation 

After you have extracted the ZIP file, you have several options to install the program.

Please note that you have to perform the installation as an administrator.

Manual installation 

Run the setup and follow the instructions of the installation wizard.

Automatic installation 

Use the MSI file.

19 Client administration



Technical settings 

After successful installation, the program will start. You will see an icon on the taskbar.

The program starts automatically when you boot Windows. To start the program manually, you can

run the start file in the installation directory.

In the context menu of the taskbar icon, you can open the log file or enable/disable debug log

output, among others.

You can also close the program via the taskbar icon. The icon then disappears.

Registry entries 

By default, the Apache HTTP client is used for communication, as this makes SSO authentication

more reliable. To use the default HTTP client instead, you can add the following name with the

value true:

The program creates the following key in the registry:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Prefs\Elo Digital Office\elowebaddons

You can enter different values in this key to configure program settings.

The program has to be restarted after every change made to the registry entries for it to take

effect.

Time interval for deleting temporary files 

The program regularly deletes temporary files accumulating during use. To set this time, you can

add a value with the following name:

HTTP port 

By default, the program uses a specific port for communication via the HTTP protocol. To change

this, you can add a value with the following name:

You do not have to enable ports specifically as the installation wizard creates a corresponding

firewall rule.

use\_default\_http\_client\_factory

temp\_deletion\_interval\_seconds

http\_port

20 Client administration



HTTPS port 

To enable communication via the HTTPS protocol, you can add a value with the following name:

The program gives HTTPS priority over HTTP.

Important

If you have to change a port, you also have to configure it for all users that do not use SSO

in their ELO user profiles. In the profileopts table, create the entry elo.webaddons.HTTP\_PORT

or elo.webaddons.HTTPS\_PORT.

Path to the keystore 

To use HTTPS, you will have to configure a keystore with a corresponding certificate. For the path to

this keystore, you can add a value with the following name:

Password for the keystore 

To use the keystore, you have to configure the password. For the password, you can add a value

with the following name:

When you start the program, it checks whether the password is encrypted. If not, a log output is

created as a recommendation containing the encrypted variant.

https\_port

keystore\_path

keystore\_password

21 Client administration



Troubleshooting 

No communication between ELO Web Client and ELO Web Add-ons 

Make sure the ELO Web Client has loaded after the ELO Web Add-ons program is ready for

operation.

Using the browser console, check whether the ELO Web Client is using both the correct

protocol and port. 

You can configure the port used by the ELO Web Client in the profileopts table, while the

port for the ELO Web Add-ons program is configured via a registry entry (see above).

These settings must match.

If you have configured HTTPS and are using self-signed certificates, your browser may

classify the connection as unsecured. You will recognize this by an error message in the ELO

Web Client browser console. In this case, you will have to add the connection in the browser

as an exception.

Internet access

Background 

To use the ELO Web Client both locally on the Intranet as well as remotely over the Internet, you

need to configure the server specifically. This document describes how to set up this configuration.

Information

For questions on the installation and configuration of the displayed server components,

please refer to the administrator of your firewall.

Primarily, a server must be installed and set up in the DMZ. If additional requirements exist for the

documents to be delivered, a second Indexserver instance (here: Repository1) must be set up. The

connections between them are shown in the following diagram:

23 Client administration



Requirements 

You need the following components to set up ELO Web Client internet access:

DMZ server

ELO server

For the DMZ server, you in turn need the following components:

Apache web server (current version)

An installation of ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise of version 21.00.000 or higher is needed for the

ELO server.

• 

• 

• 

24 Client administration



Install web server 

First, you need to install the Apache web server.

Download the Apache web server from the following address:

http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

Information

The latest binary version 2.4.25 has a bug in mod_proxy. There is a fix for this: https://

www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?p=34723

Install the server.

Information

Use the Binary Releases link on the download page to display the available versions. For the

actual download, use the mirrored pages to download the file faster and not overload the 

apache.org page.

Apache module 'mod_proxy_ajp' 

By integrating the proxy plug-in into the ELO Indexserver, only the plug-in needs to be available in

the DMZ. The ELO Indexserver sends internal requests to other ELO components (ELO Web Client,

ELO Forms Services).

Edit the file httpd.conf in the directory <apache 2.4 install directory>/conf by adding the

following lines:

It is assumed that the Apache server was installed on the same server as the ELO Application

Server and is therefore called elo-server. If not, the entries ProxyPassReverse need to be replaced

with the internal server name of the Apache server.

# Load mod_proxy_ajp module

LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so

LoadModule proxy_ajp_module modules/mod_proxy_ajp.so

ProxyPass /ix-Archive1 ajp://elo-server:9092/ix-Archive1

ProxyPassReverse /ix-Archive1 http://elo-server/ix-Archive1

Information

The port number (here: 9092) refers to the AJP connector. You can find the port number in the

conf directory within the server.xml file of the ELO Application Server.

Restart the Apache web server and check the log files for possible errors.

Information

Make sure that all ports used for internal access are unblocked on the network.

Result: All preparations are now complete. The ELO Web Client can now be accessed via the

Internet. Use the following URL:

Configuration 

Firewall 

Please note that a firewall might block access to

The firewall should allow all requests to ELO components.

External links over the Internet 

If external links created in ELO need to be available over the Internet, the ELO Indexserver

configuration needs to be adjusted accordingly. To do this, open the Indexserver Configure Options

under publicUrlBase and enter the externally available address of the Apache 2 server.

Information

This setting does not only apply for the ELO Web Client.
