ELO server – Getting started

The ELO environment 

The image above depicts the ELO servers and ELO clients along with the protocols used to

communicate between them. It helps you to understand the ELO system as a whole.

The four most fundamental components of the Apache Tomcat server engine are the ELO

Indexserver, ELO Access Manager, ELO Document Manager, and ELO iSearch module.

Microserver architecture 

The server components are programmed in Java, which offers a high level of portability.

The microserver architecture makes the system highly scalable.

Servlet implementation permits easy integration with existing systems.

3 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Architecture 

Authentication 

The ELO Access Manager is responsible for the central administration of the user list, the users

currently logged on, the user rights and permissions, and the key lists. Each client and each server

process authenticates to the ELO Access Manager at startup. The ELO Access Manager creates a

ticket to identify the client and communicate with the ELO server processes.

4 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Document storage 

A separate ELO Document Manager is required for each repository. The ELO Document Manager

saves, manages, and delivers each document on request. When using Microsoft SQL Server, a

separate database is created for each repository. When using Oracle, an independent user with the

same name as the repository is created for each separate repository.

The backup service and the EMC Centera interface are also run by the ELO Document Manager,

provided that these additional modules have been purchased.

5 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Scalability 

The ELOenterprise services are scalable. Nearly all of the services can be installed on a single

computer or they can each be installed on dedicated individual computers.

6 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



The different services can be installed to custom locations and, with a few exceptions that are

described in the respective chapters, any combination of the services can be installed on different

computers as required and depending upon the actual system requirements.

7 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



ELO server modules 

This chapter contains basic information regarding the ELO server modules. Refer to the separate

documentation for more information. You will find the relevant links in the following sections.

ELO Access Manager (ELOam) 

This section contains information about the ELO Access Manager (ELOam).

The ELO Access Manager is an ELO Indexserver plug-in (ELOix). There is no separate WAR file for

ELOam. You can access the status page of ELOam from the ELO Indexserver status page (ELOix

Status Report > Configure Options > AM Status).

One ELO Access Manager may be used to run any number of ELO repositories. All of these

repositories share the same users and certain other settings.

The ELO Access Manager has its own database, by default named eloam.

Information

The ELO Access Manager is an ELO Indexserver plug-in (ELOix). There is no separate WAR

file for ELOam. You can access the status page of ELOam from the ELO Indexserver status

page (ELOix Status Report > Configure Options > AM Status).

ELOam is automatically installed with the ELO Indexserver when you run the ELO Server Setup. The

application is in the directory <ELO>/prog\webapps\ix-plugins\private/.

ELO Document Manager (ELOdm) 

This section contains information about the ELO Document Manager (ELOdm).

You must install at least one ELO Document Manager for each repository. ELOdm manages all

documents, folders, and document metadata (including permissions) within it.

Each ELO Document Manager has its own database, which has the same name as the repository

itself.

Information

The ELO Document Manager is an ELO Indexserver plug-in (ELOix). There is no separate WAR

file for ELOdm. You can access the status page of ELOdm from the ELO Indexserver status

page (ELOix Status Report > Configure Options > DM Status).

ELOdm is automatically installed with the ELO Indexserver when you run the ELO Server Setup. The

application is in the directory <ELO>/prog\webapps\ix-plugins\private/.

8 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Please note

If you use the ELO document redaction function, read the Document redaction section.

ELO Indexserver (ELOix) 

The ELO Indexserver acts as the interface between the ELO repository and most ELO clients. In

addition, the ELO Indexserver provides iSearch functionality to all ELO clients.

Any number of ELO Indexservers may be installed for any number of repositories. You will find

more information under ELO server > Optimization > ELO Indexserver load balancing.

Client applications can connect to the ELO Indexserver either via HTTP or HTTPS via SOAP or a

proprietary Indexserver interface.

For more information, refer to the ELO Indexserver, ELO Indexserver programming guide, and ELO

Indexserver script development documentation.

ELO Automation Services (ELOas) 

ELO Automation Services are used to automate tasks within a repository. ELOas works by

processing any number of rulesets. Rulesets are XML-based instructions for a specific type of action

that are stored within the Administration folder of the repository. You can install any number of

ELOas instances for each repository. The process is described in this chapter.

There are two types of rulesets: interval-controlled rulesets and direct rulesets.

Interval-controlled rulesets are executed automatically in time intervals defined in the ruleset.

They do not require user interaction.

Information

These intervals refer to the time between ruleset starts. If you create a ruleset that takes a

long time to complete, and the interval between ruleset executions is short, this may result

in the rule being executed multiple times at the same time.

Common uses of ELOas include:

Moving entries with certain metadata within the repository

Automatically performing functions in workflows, such as assigning users

Notifying users when specific criteria in the repository are met

Various backup and maintenance tasks

For more information, refer to the ELO Automation Services documentation.

ELO Web Forms Services (ELOwf) 

ELO Web Forms Services is a web application that handles several tasks, including:

ELO workflow form components

ELO apps framework as the basis for: 

ELO Business Solutions apps

ELO Integration Client

ELO Workflow Client

ELO Teamroom Client

Running ELO apps such as: 

ELO Forms 2.0

ELO Workspaces

ELO Teamspaces

ELO Flows activity UI

Refer to the respective documentation for more information on each of these topics.

Run multiple ELOwf instances 

ELOwf allows you to run multiple instances. The URLs of the other instances must be passed to

each ELOwf instance. This is done by inserting a comma-separated list of URLs in the ELOwf 

config.xml file under the entry wfInstances.

For example, the following entry is made in the ELOwf config.xml file on serverA for a scenario with

three instances (serverA, serverB, serverC):

On serverB:

On serverC:

Please note

The URL of the ELOwf instance is entered in the ELO Indexserver proxy plug-in. Each ELOwf

instance then forms a unit with one other ELOix instance. The sessions are distributed

upstream for each unit.

ELO feed 

The ELO Indexserver plug-in "ELO feed" provides the following pages and information:

The Feed area for the entries

The Feed area in ELO Teamspaces

The My ELO work area with the Current hashtags area

The profile pages and profile images

Refer to the respective documentation for more information on each of these topics.

Information

The following list provides links to the ELO Java Client as an example. The functions are

similar in other clients.

ELO Textreader (ELOtr) 

ELO Textreader extracts text from documents and saves it in text files. After conversion, the

document contents are available to the ELO iSearch module for indexing.

Please note

Starting with ELO 21.4, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),

ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr).

For more information, refer to the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) documentation.

ELO OCR 

One of the most important aspects of the ELO system is the large range of search functions. The

server-side processes supporting these functions consist of the OCR module, ELO Textreader, and

ELO iSearch.

ELO OCR is an optional module which can be used with the ELO ECM Suite. It is installed

automatically with other ELO server modules.

The ELO OCR Service converts documents into a machine-readable format. This section goes into

detail on this function.

The OCR module runs as a server-based process on the repository server. The stored documents

are automatically indexed at regular intervals for the ELO iSearch database. Since the process runs

on the server, it does not affect the performance of the client applications. Each word within a

document is assigned an index value. The index values are structured in such a way to optimize

search times for each term.

Please note

Starting with ELO 21.4, ELO Textreader (gen. 2) replaces the previous ELO Textreader (ELOtr),

ELO Preview Converter (ELOpreview), and ELO OCR Service (ELOocr).

For more information, refer to the ELO Textreader (gen. 2) documentation.

ELO iSearch 

An ELO iSearch environment is made up of nodes and shards.

Nodes are the individual instances of the iSearch service. Each repository has one node by default.

Multiple nodes may be installed to improve search availability and performance. All iSearch nodes

are usually combined within the same cluster.

Shards are the atomic parts of the iSearch index. There is one shard per repository by default.

Increasing the number of shards across different iSearch nodes should improve indexing

performance.

For more information, refer to the ELO iSearch documentation.

ELO XML Importer (ELOim) 

The ELO XML Importer is an ELO application used to import documents automatically into an ELO

repository based on an XML control file. The ELO XML Importer monitors a specific directory at

regular intervals to start an import process.

For more information, refer to the ELO XML Importer documentation.

ELO Web Client (ELOweb) 

The ELO Web Client allows users to log on to the ELO repository via most common Internet

browsers. For more information on using the ELO Web Client, see the corresponding documentation.

Please note

A separate license is required to use the full ELO Web Client functionality. If you install the

ELO Web Client without purchasing a license, access will be restricted to devices running 

ELO for Mobile Devices.

For more information, refer to the ELO Web Client and ELO Web Client administration

documentation.

12 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



Full vs. FMD Web Client 

The ELO Web Client provides two different versions: the web client and the web client for mobile

devices.

If you have purchased a license for the ELO Web Client, you can log on to the ELO repository via

any Internet browser. You may also access the ELO repository via the ELO for Mobile Devices apps

for Android and iOS.

If you have not purchased a license for the ELO Web Client, it will install as an FMD version. This

means that you can log on to the ELO repository via the ELO for Mobile Devices apps, but not via a

browser.

If you install the ELO Web Client and later decide to purchase a full license, you do not need to

reinstall the ELO Web Client server application. Instead, change the ELO server license in the ELO

Server Setup program or in the amoptions table in the ELO Access Manager. Restart the ELO server

after changing the license number.

Status page 

The default URL to the ELO Web Client is:

http://<server name>:<port>/web-<repository name>

Add /status to the end of the URL to go to the ELO Web Client status page: To see the complete

status page, select More information. You have to log on with the administrator account for the ELO

Application Server.

13 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



From here, you can access the ELO Web Client settings, the API documentation, and so on.

Information

This status page also indicates whether you have the full version or only the FMD version. If

the license information displays FMD here, you cannot use the ELO Web Client in the

browser.

ELO Administration Console (ELOac) 

The ELO Administration Console allows you to perform administrative tasks, such as setting up and

managing groups, creating metadata forms, ELOas rulesets, and backup settings, or editing client

configurations and so on.

For more information, refer to the ELO Administration Console documentation.

ELO XC 

ELO XC is integrated in the ELO server. You need to install the ELO XC Workspace to use the

functions of this product.

For more information, refer to the ELO XC documentation.

ELO Teamroom (ELOtrm) 

You can install the ELO Teamroom Service application from the ELO Server Setup.

ELO Teamroom (ELOtrm) is designed for collaboration on group projects. An ELO Teamroom

contains parts of the ELO repository and can be used by ELO users as well as external project

members.

For more information, refer to the ELO Teamroom documentation and ELO Teamroom user

documentation

ELO Smart Link (ELOsl) 

You can install the ELO Smart Link application from the ELO Server Setup.

ELO Smart Link (ELOsl) is designed for use with SAP. The interface also includes the previous

functions of ELO Archive Link for SAP.

Information

We recommend installing ELO Smart Link for SAP on a separate ELO Application Server

(Apache Tomcat).

14 ELO server ‒ Installation and operation



For more information, refer to the ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/

4HANA® documentation under ELO Smart Link for SAP® ERP.

ELO Smart Input (ELOsi) 

You can install the ELO Smart Input application from the ELO Server Setup.

ELO Smart Input analyzes the full text of a document and extracts data from it, such as addresses,

sums, or e-mail addresses. Users receive suggestions for automatically detected data, which they

can apply to the metadata.

For more information, refer to the ELO Smart Input documentation.

ELO Rest Service 

Warning

The ELO REST API Service is DEPRECATED.

The ELO Indexserver has provided a REST interface since ELO 20.

We recommend using the ELO Indexserver client library for programming in Java and .NET.

Other programming platforms can address the ELO Indexserver REST interface.
