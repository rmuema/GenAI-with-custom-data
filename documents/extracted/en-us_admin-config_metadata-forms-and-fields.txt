Getting started

Things to consider ahead of time 

The following approach is recommended:

Which metadata forms do you need?

Which fields and settings do you want the metadata forms to have?

Which fields do you want to use in multiple metadata forms?

First, create all the field templates.

Next, create the metadata forms.

Add the fields to the metadata forms.

Information

You need to create the field templates required for the metadata forms before you create

the metadata form. You can use field templates in different metadata forms.

Create field templates

Field templates 

You can define templates for fields in the Field templates area. These templates can be used to

create metadata forms in the Metadata forms and fields area.

General 

Field group: Define a unique group name here.

Please note

The group names must be valid identifiers in JavaScript, as some ELO modules use the

group names as JavaScript variables. Use the following list as a guideline.

Maximum 40 characters

Uppercase letters only

No spaces

No special characters

No umlauts

No "ß"

4 Configuration and administration



No dashes

No numbers at the beginning of the name

No reserved words in JavaScript

Name: Define a name for the field.

Translation variable: The Translation variable field is required if you need the contents of the Name

field in multiple languages. Enter the corresponding key in the respective properties file.

Display mode: The following options enable you to specify the access and visibility settings for the

field.

Normal access: The field is visible and can be edited by users.

Read-only: The field is visible but cannot be edited by users. The contents can be transferred

to the field automatically.

Hidden: The field is hidden. The field can be used to store data that the user does not need to

see, for example. 

Input 

Data type: Define the data type of the field here.

Information

For more information on field types, refer to the chapter Field types.

Relation: Relation field types are used to link a field with the metadata of another entry.

The following conditions must be met before you can transfer metadata to a Relation field type:

There must be at least one metadata form assigned the usage Relation.

The required metadata forms must be entered in the Relation field in the field template.

Please note

You must create the metadata form and assign it the usage Relation before you create the

corresponding fields.

Minimum length: Set the minimum number of characters that need to be entered in a field.

Maximum length: Define the maximum number of characters that can be entered in a field.

Regular expression: You can use regular expressions to validate the data that was entered in a field.

Please note

An error in the expression can cause problems when entering data. Check that the regular

expressions you use work properly.

5 Configuration and administration



Mandatory field: Use this option to define whether you want a field to be mandatory.

List existing field values (F7 search): Press the F7 key when entering metadata for a document or

folder to show a list of previous entries made in the field.

External data: In this field, you can specify which data should be imported from the document

metadata (such as Exif JPG data) or from the full text information and applied to the fields

automatically.

To read Exif data from a JPG file, you must enter the exact identifier of the variable in the External

data field.

You could use Image.Resolution or FILESIZE, for example.

Please note

The names may vary by manufacturer. To determine the Exif identifiers, read the Exif data

with a script (see script example in the publication 99 script examples) or use an external

program.

Default value: Define the default value for the field here.

Tooltip: Create a tooltip for the field. This could contain information about the required format for

entering data, for example.

Translation variable: The Translation variable field is required if you need the contents of the Tooltip

field in multiple languages. Enter the corresponding key in the respective properties file.

Properties 

Field with high priority: If you enable the option Field with high priority, the information in the fields

will be displayed after the file name in the tree view.

Show field when checking in: The field is displayed when checking in. You can still enter metadata

information at this point.

Pass on to child entries: This option enables child entries to use entries in this field. The fields must

have the same group name for this to work.

Allow input inheritance from parent element: This option enables you to pass on inheritable entries

from the parent field. The fields must have the same group name for this to work.

Automatically add * before search term: Adds the placeholder * before the query text when using

this metadata form to search in ELO. This defines a search as ending with.

Automatically add * after search term: Adds the placeholder * after the query text when using this

metadata form to search in ELO. This defines a search as beginning with. Example: If you enter 15

to this field, the search returns all documents with the entry 15 at the start of the field (ELO

searches for 15*).

6 Configuration and administration



Disable tokenization: When this option is enabled, the contents of the short name are not split into

tokens and the entire character string in the field is written to the full text database.

Exclude from iSearch: The contents of this field are excluded from ELO iSearch and the contents are

not added to the full text database.

Keyword list 

The Edit keyword list link takes you to the page where you can edit the keyword list.

Entry only allowed with keyword list: Select this option to only allow entries to this field from

keyword lists when entering metadata. This enables you to structure your metadata and helps

prevent manual errors. You can create an individual keyword list for each field (group name). Do the

same for each input field, i.e. create a keyword list for each field of a metadata form. This ensures

that your metadata is standardized.

Translated keyword list: The keyword list is taken into account when using the automatic

translation function. Please note that the terms in the keyword list must be translated manually in

the translation table for automatic translations to occur in the client program.

Dynamic keyword list: A dynamic keyword list can only be integrated with the help of scripts. For

more information, refer to the ELO Indexserver programming guide documentation, Dynamic

keyword lists section.

Field permissions 

This is where you define the permissions to the field.

AND group: Use this button to group users or user groups.

Overview of metadata forms 

In the Overview of metadata forms area, you can see which metadata forms the field template is

being used in.

Save: Click Save to confirm new settings or changes to the metadata form.

Cancel: Click Cancel to discard any changes or new entries for a field template. Changes are not

saved.

Field types 

ELO provides different types of fields. You should select the appropriate field type depending on the

application and your requirements.

To select this type of field in the ELO Administration Console, go to Field templates > Input > Data

type.

The following field types are available:

Text: In Text field types, you can enter any characters.

File reference: Import a file reference from the file reference generator.

Date: In Date field types, the user can select a date from an integrated calendar.

Please note

The field type Date is only provided for compatibility reasons. Please use the ISO date field

type instead.

ISO date: In ISO date field types, the user can select a date from an integrated calendar. The date is

saved in ISO format (YYYYMMDD).

List entry: In the List entry field type, the user must store a hierarchical keyword list in a text file.

The user selects keywords from this list when entering metadata.

Please note

The List entry field type is available for compatibility reasons. In newer ELO client versions,

this field type is treated the same as the Text field type.

8 Configuration and administration



Number: In Number type fields, you can only enter numbers and number separators. If you enter

any other characters in this field, a warning message will appear.

Numeric fixed width: You can only enter numbers and number separators to a Numeric fixed width

field type. If you enter any other characters in this field, a warning message will appear. If you see

this message, correct your entry. You must enter a value greater than zero to the Maximum length

field to define the width.

Numeric fixed width, 1, 2, 4, or 6 decimal places: In the field type Numeric fixed width, x decimal

places, you can only enter numbers and corresponding number separators. You must enter a value

greater than zero to the Maximum length field to define the width.

If you enter a number when assigning metadata, it will be automatically be completed according to

the following convention:

Number without decimal point: ELO will automatically add a decimal point and the selected

number of decimal places (always zeros). This always adds zeros.

Number with decimal point: ELO will add zeros after the last decimal until the required

number of decimal places has been reached.

Please note

Using the type Numeric fixed width, 1, 2, 4, or 6 decimal places and configuring a setting in

the Maximum length field at the same time can result in conflicts.

In such cases, at least the following must be taken into account for the setting in the 

Maximum length field:

Places before the point

The point

The defined number of decimal places

If you expect multiple characters before the point, you will have to select a larger value for

the Maximum length field.

Example 1 

The setting Numeric, fixed width, 2 decimal places is selected. If the user enters the value "1" in

the field, ELO will change it to 1.00.

Example 2 

The setting Numeric, fixed width, 4 decimal places is selected. If the user enters the value "4.2" in

the field, ELO will change it to 4.2000.

This ensures that entries always have the same number of decimal places.

Thesaurus: The Thesaurus field type provides word groups in a field which the user can select from

a menu in a dialog box. The dialog box is opened by right-clicking the corresponding field.

9 Configuration and administration



User field: You can right-click fields of the type User to open a list of all active users and groups in

ELO.

Relation: Relation field types are used to link a field with the metadata of another entry.

The following conditions must be met before you can transfer metadata to a Relation field type:

There must be at least one metadata form assigned the usage Relation.

The required metadata forms must be entered in the Relation field in the field template.

Please note

You must create the metadata form and assign it the usage Relation before you create the

corresponding fields.

10 Configuration and administration



Metadata forms

Create metadata form 

Please note

When configuring metadata forms, the number of forms used should not reach double-digits.

A separate search index is built for each metadata form. A large number of metadata forms

therefore requires a large amount of RAM and hard disk space for the ELO iSearch.

This applies for first generation and second generation metadata forms.

Click the Add keyword button (green plus icon).

The New metadata form dialog box opens.

Enter a name for the metadata form in the Name field.

Basic data 

Name: Enter the name of the metadata form here.

Translation variable: This field can be used to define a variable which can be used for customizing

the program with scripts or for translations, e.g. the name of the metadata form.

Last change: In this field, you can see when the metadata form was modified last.

ID: Identification number of the metadata form. This is automatically assigned by the system.

GUID: This field contains the GUID of the metadata form, which is allocated by the system.

Save data as a table: Click the Save data as a table function if you do not want to save the data of

the entries filed with this metadata form in the usual database structure (objkeys table). The

entries are saved to a flat database table instead. This database table has one column per index

value and one row per document. This may be required in specific cases to optimize search

performance.

Important

You cannot convert data back to the usual database structure. Check carefully if this setting

is necessary in your case. You will find more information under ELO server- installation and

operation > Optimization > ELO metadata table.

Filing definition

Basic information on filing definition syntax 

Use the following structure for a filing definition:

[¶folder1¶folder2¶]+Lx(v,y)+ ...

Information

The pilcrow character ("¶") is used to separate folder levels. The keyboard shortcut for the

pilcrow symbol is ALT + 0182. Alternative: Click the pilcrow symbol to the right of the Filing

path field.

Example 1 

You want to file invoices in an alphabetical folder structure sorted by the first letter of the customer

name. The Sales folder contains the child folder Customers. The Customers folder contains an

alphabetical index.

The metadata form in this example uses the field Customers(L1).

Filing path

Enter the following path in the Filing path field:

[¶Sales¶Customers¶]+L1(1,1)

1. 

27 Configuration and administration



The contents of the Filing path field are automatically applied to the Filing definition field

when you exit the field.

Information

[ … ]: The square brackets indicate defined folders. These folders must be exactly the

same in ELO so that they can be found. They can be created automatically. To do this,

the Create filing path automatically option must be enabled.

¶: The pilcrow character separates levels.

+: The plus character links the fixed part of the filing definition with the variable part.

L1 (1,1): ELO selects the first letter of the Customers field (1,1), i.e. the first letter of

the customer name.

Click Save to save the changes to the metadata form.

Now, if a document with this metadata form is filed using the Automatic filing function, the

filing definition applies.

For example, a document from the customer Smith will be automatically filed to Sales//

Customers//S.

Example 2 

You have created a child folder for each customer within the Sales folder. Each of these child

folders contains additional folders, such as Invoices, Offers, Delivery notes.

The metadata form in this example uses the fields Customers (L1) and Document type (L2).

Enter the following path in the Filing path field:

[¶Sales¶]+L1+[¶]+L2

Information

2. 

1. 

28 Configuration and administration



The contents of the Filing path field are automatically applied to the Filing definition

field when you exit the field.

[¶Sales¶]: ELO searches the repository for the Sales folder. The second pilcrow

character indicates that a second level must follow.

+L1: The name of the child folder must match the contents of the first field

(Customers).

+[¶]: ELO searches for another child folder.

+L2: The name of the child folder must match the contents of the second field

(Document type).

Click Save to save the changes to the metadata form.

Now, if a document with this metadata form is filed using the Automatic filing function, the

filing definition applies.

For example, an invoice for the customer Johnson is automatically filed to Sales//Johnson//

Invoice.

Fixed fields 

The following variables relate to fields that exist on every metadata form. These variables can also

be used for filing definitions.

LK: Short name

LD: Date

LA: Filing date

In ELO, you can file a document to several folders at the same time. However, ELO does not file

multiple copies of the document. Instead, the same document is stored in different folders as

references. If changes are made to a document, the changes also apply to all references to the

document.

Example 

You want to file all orders for a single year to the Orders folder. The Orders folder contains a folder

for each year.

You also want to file the orders as references in the corresponding customer folder.

The metadata form in this example uses the fields Customer (L1) and Order date (L3).

Filing path 

To file documents to the Orders folder, enter the following path in the Filing path field:

[¶Orders¶]+L3(1,4)

The contents of the Filing path field are automatically applied to the Filing definition field

when you exit the field.

Information

[¶Orders¶]: ELO searches for the Orders folder.

+L3 (1,4): The field Order date uses the ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD). This means that ELO

needs to read four characters for the year, starting with the first (1,4).

Reference path 

To create a new path, click Add reference path.

The Reference path 1 field appears.

Enter the following path in the Reference path 1 field:

[¶Customers¶]+L1

The contents of the Reference path 1 field are automatically applied to the Filing definition

field and added to the filing path when you exit the field.

|: If a filing definition contains multiple paths, each path must be separated with a

pipe symbol ("|"). The ELO Administration Console creates the pipe symbol

automatically as soon as you have entered a reference path in a corresponding field.

To create the pipe symbol manually, use the keyboard shortcut: ALT+GR+ <.

[¶Customers¶]: ELO searches for the Customers folder.

+L1: The name of the child folder must match the contents of the first field

(Customer).

Information

Once you have created a complete filing definition with multiple paths, you can

enter it to the Filing path field. The ELO Administration Console splits the paths

automatically as soon as it finds a pipe symbol.

Click Save to save the changes to the metadata form.

Now, if a document with this metadata form is filed using the Automatic filing function, the

filing definition applies.

An order for the customer Allimports Inc. from 2020 will be automatically filed to Orders//

2020, and as a reference to the Customers//Allimports Inc. folder.

Information

When using variables in paths, it is recommended that you enable the options Create

filing path automatically and Create reference path automatically.

33 Configuration and administration



Filing definition by longest match 

Assume you want to file delivery notes from your suppliers with a specific metadata form in

alphabetical order. In addition, you want to distinguish between S, Sm, and St. This allows you to

file suppliers such as Smith, and Stiller separately.

Prepare folders 

Create a Purchasing folder with a Suppliers child folder.

In the Suppliers folder, create a child folder for each letter of the alphabet. Also create folders

named Sm and St.

The metadata form in this example uses the field Suppliers (L1).

Enter the following path in the Filing path field:

[¶Purchasing¶Suppliers¶]+L1(1,1)+[%]+L1(2,2)

The contents of the Filing path field are automatically applied to the Filing definition field

when you exit the field.

[¶Purchasing¶Suppliers¶]: ELO searches for the Purchasing folder and the Suppliers

child folder.

+L1(1,1): ELO starts by checking the first character of the first field.

+[%]: The percent sign instructs ELO to file by the longest match. If it finds a match

for the first character, ELO carries on checking.

+L1(2,2): ELO checks two characters from the second character in the first field.

With this filing definition, ELO checks whether a folder exists under the specified path

(Purchasing//Suppliers) that matches the first three characters of the contents of the

first field.

ELO uses the longest match for filing.

Click Save to save the changes to the metadata form.

Now, if a document with this metadata form is filed using the Automatic filing function, the

filing definition applies.

A document for the supplier Sanborn can only be filed to the S folder. A document for the

supplier Smith also has an S at the beginning. However, the match for the Sm folder is

longer, so ELO files the document there.
