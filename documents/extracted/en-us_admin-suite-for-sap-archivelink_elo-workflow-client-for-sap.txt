ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to install and configure the ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP.

This client enables SAP users to participate in ELO workflows within the SAP system. Fully

integrated into the SAP system, the client enables users to process all steps of a workflow and is

completely integrated into the SAP front end.

In detail, it contains the following functions:

Accept/delete workflow

Delegate/hand off/return/postpone workflow

Structure and document preview, workflow form view, and document feed

Security and licensing requirements 

When using the ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP, the systems must be licensed properly. The

user must be licensed in the SAP system and the ELO system. In case of doubt, clear this up with

SAP and/or your system specialist. ELO is not liable for any license violations.

To use the ELO Workflow Clients for SAP® ERP, your computer must meet the following system

requirements and release statuses of ELO and SAP:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise 20.00.000 or higher

The following SAP versions or higher:

Installation 

A license for the ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP includes functions for processing ELO

workflows in the SAP GUI. This enables SAP users to participate in ELO workflows without having to

change programs. The client contains an SAP transport that has to be imported to the SAP target

system.

You will find the current installation files on the ELO SupportWeb in the following area:

Integration > SAP® ERP > ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® > ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP.

SAP function module 

Inform your customer or the SAP partner about the SAP transport to be installed and provide it to

them.

The current SAP transport is available on the ELO SupportWeb.

Information

Inform your customers or SAP partner of the following:

The standard SAP transport routes must be used.

All developments and functions within the transport in ELO were developed in a

separate SAP namespace, called /ELO/.

You may have to enable the Ignore Invalid Component Version option when importing the

SAP transport.

It is also possible that you will encounter warnings when importing the transport due to

different release statuses (return code 8), which can be ignored.

Once an SAP transport has successfully been transported to the SAP systems, you can provide your

customer/the SAP partner with the technical description for the /ELO/WF_CLIENT transaction.

Configuring permissions 

To use the client, permissions are required for all users in the SAP system. The following table

provides a list of all permissions required in the SAP system.

Configuration 

To install the interface, go to the ELO SupportWeb and download the current version of the

ELO Workflow Client for SAP® ERP to the ELO server, then extract the files to a temporary

folder.

Your directory will now contain the transport files for your SAP system.

First, you have to upload them to your SAP system (transaction CG3Z).

Please note

The files have to be stored in the correct folders so that they can be transferred to the

transport chain (transaction STMS) manually later on.

cofiles file (K*) in the cofiles folder (/usr/sap/trans/cofiles)

data file (R*) in the data folder (/usr/sap/trans/data).

Information

The path to the cofiles file and data file may have been custom-configured depending on the

system. For this reason, first check which directory is specified under DIR_TRANS

(transaction: AL11).

Active sessions 

You can get an overview of all active sessions and manually end them here.

Event settings 

The client can respond to special events and run functions according to the configuration. In the

ELO forms, a special event embedded in HTML (beginning with sapevent:) has to be implemented.

This allows you to book a posting document "online" from an ELO form (opened in the ELO

Workflow Client for SAP® ERP) in the SAP ERP via batch input, for example.

Fig.: Event settings

For example, if the sapevent: FI_POST is thrown, the method FI_POST of the class /ELO/

CL_WF_C_HTTP_EVENTS is called.

Notification settings 

So that ELO Workflow Clients for SAP® ERP users are informed of the tasks assigned to them, you

can configure notification settings here.

These are read and applied by the supplied report /ELO/WF_NOTIFY. We recommend planning the

report as a job so that it's started periodically and the user is kept informed.
