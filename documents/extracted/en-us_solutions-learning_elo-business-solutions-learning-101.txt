Introduction 

Structure of the documentation 

The goal of this documentation is to explain all functions of Business Solution ELO Learning.

Basics 

The Basics chapter explains the basics of the ELO Learning program interface.

Getting started 

The Getting started chapter essentially explains how ELO Learning works. This chapter is short and

helps experienced ELO users get started quickly.

Possible actions and other elements 

The remaining chapters address possible actions and other elements of ELO Learning.

Target audience 

This documentation is addressed to Business Solution ELO Learning users who manage courses.

Separate documentation is available for administrators on the ELO SupportWeb.

The scope of functions presented in this documentation may differ greatly from those in your

client.

If you do not find functions described in this documentation in your client, you do not have

permission to perform the action.

3 Business Solution ELO Learning



Basics 

Basic principle 

Business Solution ELO Learning assists you in managing and booking courses.

ELO Learning consists of two components:

Course administration: Courses are managed in the ELO client. You can create courses,

sessions, and participants here and get an overview of available courses on the dashboard.

Learning platform: Participants can enroll in and attend courses on the corresponding learning

platform.

If ELO Learning is used together with ELO Knowledge, individual courses can be linked to spaces in

order to allow discussions among the participants.

Different categories of courses are available:

Online: This category includes:

Virtual classrooms: These courses are attended via the optional integration with

provider GoToWebinar.

E-learning courses

Videos

Face-to-face: The course is carried out on site, and not on the learning platform.

Course enrollment: Depending on the settings, courses can either be booked on the learning

platform, or participants are enrolled by the course administrator.

You can create individual courses or learning paths, which are made up individual related courses.

Once participants have successfully completed courses, certificates can be created automatically.

General note 

ELO Learning works with the following clients:

ELO Web Client

ELO Java Client

ELO Desktop Client

Information

In this documentation, we use screenshots from the ELO Web Client.

Requirements 

Your administrator must have configured ELO Learning for you.

Program interface 

Fig.: Business Solution ELO Learning program interface

You will find ELO Learning functions in the following areas:

1 'Learning' group on the 'New' ribbon tab

You can create new courses via the Learning group. Once you have created a course and you select

it, the Course tab appears. You can edit the course using the functions on the Course tab.

2 'Courses & participants', 'Courses and seminars', and 'New course' tiles in the tile navigation

The Courses & participants and New course tiles are only available if you can create courses.

The Courses and seminars tile is available to all users who can attend courses. This tile takes you

to the learning platform.

Fig.: 'Course' tab

3 'Course' tab

5 Business Solution ELO Learning



The Course tab appears if you have created a course and selected it in the repository in the 

Courses folder or on the dashboard.

This tab contains functions for editing the selected course.

Fig.: 'Enrollment' tab

4 'Enrollment' tab

The Enrollment tab appears if you select a course participant in the repository in the Enrollments

folder or on the dashboard.

This tab contains functions relevant for course participants.

Repository 

The structure and appearance of the repository depend greatly on your specific configuration. The

default state is described here.

Courses 

Courses are the foundation for all other functions in the course management area. A folder is

created for each course.

Fig.: Course folder

Courses are stored under //Course management//Courses.

Courses can have the following statuses:

D – Draft: The course has been created and is now being edited.

T – Preview: The course is still being edited, but has been announced on the learning

platform.

P – Released: The course has been released on the learning platform and can be booked.

6 Business Solution ELO Learning



Sessions 

Sessions are created within courses. Face-to-face training and virtual classrooms require sessions.

You cannot create sessions for the other course types.

Participants 

For courses without sessions, participants are created within the courses, and for courses with

sessions, they are created within the sessions.

Course form 

Fig.: 'Course' form

Each created course contains a form, which you can later edit.

The form contains the tabs Overview, Course data, Contents, Requirements, and Settings.

With the exception of the Overview tab, the fields of all tabs can be edited. The Overview tab uses

information from the fields on the other tabs.

7 Business Solution ELO Learning



Course materials 

On creation, each course folder contains the Course materials folder. In this folder, you can create

course materials that the learning platform then offers participants for download.

Session form 

Fig.: 'Session' form

Each created session contains a form, which you can later edit.

Besides the form, the session folder contains the participants enrolled in this session.

8 Business Solution ELO Learning



Participant form 

Fig.: 'Enrollment' form

Each created participant contains a form.

The form contains the tabs Participant and Course data.

Several fields on the Participant tab can be edited, but this is generally unnecessary. The status of a

participant can be changed via the drop-down menu. However, normally the status is updated

automatically when you or participants trigger actions, for example closing an e-learning session.

The fields on the Course data tab give you an overview of the course and cannot be edited.

Getting started 

In this section, we will present ELO Learning based on two examples. These examples perform the

most important functions of ELO Learning, from creating a course to releasing it on the learning

platform.

This is a short guide. Follow the links for a more detailed description of the individual steps.

Learning path assigned to participants 

All new employees in your company are onboarded via a learning path. This learning path contains

an e-learning course and a video.

The learning path is assigned by the course administrator and cannot be booked by employees

themselves.

You need: A finished e-learning course and a video

1 Create courses

Fig.: 'Create a course' dialog box

Create a new Learning path type course: New tab > Learning > New course. In this example,

leave Release date blank.

Create two courses with the types E-learning and Video.
