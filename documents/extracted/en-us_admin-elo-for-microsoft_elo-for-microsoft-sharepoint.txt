ELO for Microsoft SharePoint

Introduction and requirements 

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint (ELOsp) enables you to archive documents from Microsoft SharePoint

libraries to ELO. You complete this task using jobs, which you create in the configuration interface.

A job allows you to connect a SharePoint library to a folder in ELO. In the process, you can transfer

information from the SharePoint columns to the metadata in ELO. You can also set filters, such as if

you only want to archive documents that are older than a certain age.

The jobs can be processed at scheduled intervals or manually. A document is only archived once

and no other versions are transferred. It is only possible to archive from SharePoint to ELO.

The ELO Integration Client enables you to view folders and documents from ELO in SharePoint. ELO

for Microsoft SharePoint simplifies the configuration and provides web parts for Microsoft SharePoint

2019 and Microsoft SharePoint Online.

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint is a Windows service and can be installed on a Windows server

independently of Microsoft SharePoint and the ELO Indexserver. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2

must be installed.

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint supports the ELO Indexserver version 12 and higher.

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint is compatible with both SharePoint On-Premises version 2013 and

higher (Service Pack 1) and Office 365 (SharePoint Online). SharePoint 2019 must be configured for

apps.

The configuration interface works with most browsers, including the latest versions of Google

Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.

App registration in Azure

If you are using SharePoint Online, you must have an app registration for ELOsp. This app

registration requires the following rights:

Microsoft Graph: 

User.Read (Delegated)

SharePoint: 

Sites.FullControl.All (Application)

The client ID (also called app ID) obtained through the app registration, as well as the tenant ID, is

subsequently required for the SharePoint connection in ELOsp.

Installation 

To begin installation, extract the contents of the installation package to an empty directory.

In the file "appsettings.json", you can set the HTTP binding component, which is the URL for

accessing the configuration interface. To do so, change the value

"urls": "http://localhost:5000"

The file "appsettings.json" is automatically created at startup if it does not exist. You can test ELO

for Microsoft SharePoint with the command

ELOsp.exe –console

To use SSL, you must have a valid certificate that is registered for the port. For example

netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:5000 certhash=e9fafc58a98e3d5ddc0ab971eff53e5a82136255

appid="{9432ee86-c21b-4eb8-bd89-f670fbf44931}"

"certhash" is the fingerprint of the certificate and "appid" is any GUID. For more information, see:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-

with-an-ssl-certificate

As a Windows service, you can register ELO for Microsoft SharePoint in Windows PowerShell using

the following command:

New-Service -Name "ELO SharePoint" -BinaryPathName E:\Publish\ELOsp\ELOsp.exe

Start the service with:

Start-Service -Name "ELO SharePoint"

Check the installation of the service and make sure that you select Automatic as the startup type.

Authentication 

You can access the interface through the URL or URLs that you configured as the HTTP binding

component. When the page is requested, you are asked to log on to an ELO Indexserver, which you

can do with any administration account.

6 ELO for Microsoft



Settings 

After you have logged on, you need to specify an administrative account for authentication with the

ELO Indexserver. ELO for Microsoft SharePoint connects to the ELO server with this account. It can

be the same server used to log on to ELO for Microsoft SharePoint. We recommend that you create

a dedicated account for this.

You must also specify a name for the configuration or select an existing configuration. These are

stored on the ELO server in the directory //Administration//ELOsp in a folder with the specified

name. Only one configuration is valid for each ELOsp instance. All settings that are not in the file

"appsettings.json" are stored in the instance. Keep in mind that you must confirm a new entry with

the Enter key.

Configurations can only be deleted if they are currently not connected to the instance. To delete the

active configuration, you must first disconnect it using the Disconnect button.

Next, you configure the SharePoint connection. The account used to log on should have

administrative rights to all site collections that are to be archived. The URL can be any site

collection on the SharePoint server.

7 ELO for Microsoft



To support authentication via app ID and certificate, you can check or uncheck the SharePoint

Online (Office 365) box in the form.

Specify the service URL in the General area for interactive archiving and possible future features.

This is usually the same URL as the one used to access the configuration interface. ELOsp

extensions of the SharePoint interface address the ELOsp service through the service URL.

8 ELO for Microsoft



You can also define the settings for the ELO Integration Client here. Single sign-on must be enabled.

For SharePoint Online, you also need to specify the configuration ID for ELOauth. Refer to the ELO

Integration Client chapter for more information.

Jobs 

This chapter explains how to configure and manage jobs in ELO for Microsoft SharePoint.

Job configuration 

You can now start to configure the individual jobs. You can access the Job Configuration via the

overview page of ELO for Microsoft SharePoint.

Required settings 

Click the New button to configure a job.

The following screenshot illustrates an example of a job configuration.

10 ELO for Microsoft



The name must be unique and as self-explanatory as possible so that the job can be found quickly

on the start page.

The path in ELO should be an empty directory. ELO for Microsoft SharePoint will create the directory

if it doesn't exist.

You can select the URL of the site collections from a drop-down menu. It is possible that the site

collection you want is not displayed. This may be because the SharePoint search has not been

configured or has not been executed. Click the X to enter a different URL and press Enter to confirm.

11 ELO for Microsoft



You also need to select the URL you want from the web pages and then the document library.

At the end of the archiving job, you can choose between three options:

Archived documents are replaced by an ELO link and denoted with an ELO icon in a new

column.

Archived documents are only denoted with an ELO icon in a new column.

Archived documents are deleted.

In execution mode, you can choose between a manual or scheduled start. If you select Timer, you

will see additional options for scheduling the execution interval. The minimum interval is currently

one hour.

To ensure that the configuration is valid, you also need to select the metadata form that is used to

store documents and folders.

Deploy SharePoint customizations 

To ensure that archived documents are marked as such and to improve the visual experience, you

need to do some customizations in the website collection. The web part for the ELO Integration

Client is also installed here. If this has not been done for the web site collection or library, a red

warning icon is displayed. Click Deploy to open the dialog box.

To ensure there are no errors, all steps must be completed successfully (see following screenshot).

1. 

2. 

3. 

12 ELO for Microsoft



The type and number of steps can vary slightly depending on the SharePoint version. If the job is

successful, you will see the following green message.

You can use the Rerun button to execute the job again, such as to enable interactive archiving.

Metadata mapping 

The default fields of the metadata form are completed automatically. For the other fields, you can

select the appropriate SharePoint columns. It is always possible to convert into an ELO text field,

and conversion is available for some combinations of ELO and SharePoint types.

When you enter text, the columns are filtered, searching the title, internal name, and type. If a

SharePoint type cannot be converted to the metadata field type, a message appears.

13 ELO for Microsoft



Filters 

It is also possible to specify up to three filters to restrict the selection of documents to be archived.

The filters are linked with AND. This means that only the documents that meet all filter criteria are

archived.

14 ELO for Microsoft



There are two types of filters available:

CAML:

This filter represents a subset of the SharePoint query language CAML. For more information,

especially about the operators, go to:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/schema/query-schema

RegEx:

This creates a filter with regular expressions (RegEx). You can get an editor here, for example:

https://regex101.com

You can use the button What If to perform a test run. No documents are archived in the test run;

you only see the results.

Additional marking 

You can use the additional marking option to specify a value that is written to the specified field

when archiving is complete.

As shown in the figure, this can be used to change the content type, for example.

Since it is possible to write any value to the selected column, this can lead to loss of data under

certain circumstances. You should test the configuration first on a test system.

Job administration 

The start page shows a list of the configured jobs. If you enabled processing at scheduled intervals,

the next execution time is shown. While a job is running, the corresponding buttons are disabled.

Under Progress in the header area of ELO for Microsoft SharePoint, you can view the current job

status and the results of past jobs.

SharePoint customizations 

This chapter addresses customizations in ELO for Microsoft SharePoint.

Structural customizations 

ELO for Microsoft SharePoint creates site columns and a content type. They contain information

about archiving and enable you to view content in the SharePoint interface. You must not change

these under any circumstances.

App 

Starting with Microsoft SharePoint 2019, an app is installed and enabled for the site collections for

which a job exists.

List view 

In Link and Mark only mode, an ELO icon appears for archived documents in the additional Web

Client column. This is automatically added to the view. The icon contains a link to the document in

the ELO Web Client. Due to restrictions in SharePoint Online, ELOsp customizations are not made in

the standard view. The document icons are white and the link to the ELO Web Client is a text.

You can also display the columns of ELO for Microsoft SharePoint in a list view, if required.

In Link mode, the document is replaced by an ELO link. This allows users to open the document

from other clients.

The standard SharePoint view looks like this:

18 ELO for Microsoft



The modern SharePoint view looks like this:

19 ELO for Microsoft



Result in ELO 

After successful archiving, the documents are stored in ELO with the configured metadata.

20 ELO for Microsoft



ELO Integration Client 

This chapter addresses the ELO Integration Client in ELO for Microsoft SharePoint.

Function 

The ELO Integration Client is a root entry from the ELO repository depending on the parameters and

configuration. A document view component is used. If the root entry is a folder, users can navigate

within this folder and view all child entries of the folder.

A number of ELO functions are available for the current entry depending on the configuration. Users

can search for entries from the repository (including outside of the root entry) to create a reference

to individual search results within the root entry.

For more information, refer to the documentation for the ELO Integration Client.

Configuration 

The Integration Client area in the header of ELO for Microsoft SharePoint guides you through the

installation.

In the first step, the requirements are checked.

If a configuration for the ELO Integration Client has not yet been stored in the repository, you can

create a default configuration in the second step using the Create Configuration button. You will find

more information about the configuration file in the documentation for the ELO Integration Client.

21 ELO for Microsoft



In the next step, you can test the client. After you have logged on, you should see the following

screen, and there should not be any warning messages.

Single sign-on 

There are two options for single sign-on (SSO) with the ELO Integration Client: LDAP with Active

Directory and OAuth/OpenID Connect with Azure AD. These require correct configuration in ELO and,

if necessary, in the browser (Windows authentication) or Azure AD.

ELOsp only supports embedding of the ELO Integration Client in SharePoint with the correct

parameters. Firstly, with the wizard that generates the HTML code, and secondly with the web part

available starting with SharePoint 2019.

SharePoint server (On-Premises) 

For single sign-on to work, Active Directory must be used as the ID provider for the SharePoint

server. You need to configure the ELO LDAP interface and import the users. For more information,

see the ELO Indexserver LDAP Interface documentation.

22 ELO for Microsoft



SharePoint Online 

To enable automatic authentication when using SharePoint Online, you must install the "ELOauth"

module. You can get information about this in the documentation "ELOauth Plugin". You also need

to create a configuration for the connection to Azure AD.

Enter the name of the configuration in the general settings of ELOsp; azure is used as an example

here. The userProperty determines the user mapping in Azure AD and ELO. In this example, it is the

user's surname, which is then mapped to the name of the ELO user. Enter the other values for 

de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json as follows:

You need to register a new app for the SharePoint Online tenant in Azure AD. Under App 

registrations, click New registration. Select Single tenant and enter the redirect URL using the

following structure:

{

"azure": {

"api": "azure",

"userProperty": "surname",

"appKey": "",

"appSecret": "",

"azureTenant": ""

}

}

https://<server_name(domain)>;/ix-<repository>;/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.auth/oauth20cb/

23 ELO for Microsoft



Copy the Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID from the overview page of the new

registration and enter them to the ELOauth configuration.

Under Certificates & secrets, generate a new key with New client secret. Select a name and

runtime according to your requirements. Enter the key as the value for appSecret.

Integration with Microsoft SharePoint 

Web part in SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint Online 

Starting with SharePoint 2019, ELO for Microsoft SharePoint provides a web part for embedding the

ELO Integration Client. Please refer to the Microsoft documentation for information about the

functionality of web parts.

The editor part offers some basic settings. The default settings use the values stored by ELO for

Microsoft SharePoint in the site collection. You should only change the URL of the ELO Indexserver

in exceptions.

Entering a GUID enables you to restrict navigation to a single folder or display a single document.

24 ELO for Microsoft



Code adaptation in Microsoft SharePoint 2013 and 2016 

The fourth step creates an HTML fragment that you can integrate into Microsoft SharePoint in

different ways. The easiest way is to use the Embed Code method as shown in the figure. You can

modify the parameters in SharePoint 2019 as well as in the SharePoint Online code.

25 ELO for Microsoft



Logs 

You can change the log file directory in the settings under the Log tab. You can also set the log level

to obtain more or less detailed information.

Under Log in the header area of ELO for Microsoft SharePoint, you can see an overview of the

current log messages. You can change the log level with the drop-down menu.

To render other options visible, click the icon with the toolbox.

To view a menu with additional filter options, move the cursor over the column headers.

26 ELO for Microsoft



The top level of the log directory contains the log files with the previously configured log level. A

new file is created when a new day begins.

The Worker directory contains JSON files with the result of the job execution.

The log messages are stored temporarily in the CLEF folder for viewing in the browser.

To save disk space, we recommend that you enable Windows folder compression.
