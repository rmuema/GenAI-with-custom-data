ELO Smart Input

Introduction 

Overview 

ELO Smart Input is an intelligent assistant that helps you enter metadata for incoming documents

semi-automatically.

This module analyzes the full text of a document and extracts data from it, such as addresses,

sums, or e-mail addresses. You can then simply select from the suggested metadata options that

are shown. The suggestions must be checked and saved manually. In the ELO Smart Input

configuration, you can add regular expressions to search for specific information in documents and

compare matches against existing database tables.

You can use ELO Smart Input with the ELO Java Client and the ELO Web Client.

How it works 

ELO Smart Input is based on an incoming and target folder principle.

The incoming folder is where you save documents that have not yet been assigned

metadata.

Use ELO Smart Input to enter the metadata for the documents.

After the metadata is entered, the documents are moved to a defined target folder.

The folder and appearance of the tile have to be defined in the ELOsi Administration interface first.

You can then switch to the ELO Smart Input interface. You will reach the interface via the tile

navigation in the ELO Web Client or ELO Java Client.

Fig.: ELO Smart Input suggestions in the ELO Web Client

ELO Smart Input is an interactive assistant that helps you enter metadata for incoming documents

semi-automatically. The module analyzes the full text of a document and extracts data from it,

such as addresses, sums, or e-mail addresses. Users receive suggestions for automatically

detected data, which they can apply to the metadata. Selected suggestions are highlighted in blue.

If the suggestion isn't correct, you can either select one of the alternative suggestions or complete

the field manually.

Click Save to finish entering the metadata.

The document is moved to the filing path defined in the configuration.

What can be recognized? 

Many patterns are offered out-of-the-box:

E-mails, date values, times, IBANs, VAT IDs, URLs

Addresses (Germany-wide)

Sums (including gross value, net value, and VAT recognition)

Values of ELO keyword lists

With a regular expression, you can define, extend, and make changes to custom patterns (such as a

specific ID pattern). You can also import data sets from CSV or TSV files or databases.

4 ELO Smart Input



Automatic classification 

ELO Smart Input has an integrated automatic document classifier. For each document, the system

identifies the likely document type (e.g. invoice, delivery note, advertisement) and what metadata

form is most relevant. Of course, only metadata forms that have a mapping definition are selected.

The classifier is universal and self-learning, meaning it works for every language, document type,

and metadata form. It learns with each document whose metadata has been saved via ELO Smart

Input, becoming more and more accurate over time.

Please note

We recommend saving documents with the appropriate metadata form right from the start

to quickly improve the classifier's learning curve.

If the document already has a metadata form a mapping has been defined for, the classifier is

skipped. The system assumes that the document is already assigned the correct metadata form.

Differences between the ELO Java Client and ELO Web Client 

Both clients have advantages and disadvantages when using ELO Smart Input.

The ELO Java Client features Click OCR to quickly complete the metadata with the click of a mouse.

In the web view component, the date and list fields are rendered as normal fields.

The ELO Web Client has a date picker, lists with drop-down menus, and autocomplete, provided you

use an up-to-date browser. Click OCR is not possible in the ELO Web Client.

Installation 

Installation with the ELO Server Setup 

This module is installed using the ELO Server Setup.

In the ELO Server Setup, switch to the Applications tab.

In your repository area, select the ELO Smart Input application from the drop-down menu and

click Add.

Fig.: Adding ELO Smart Input in the ELO Server Setup

ELO Smart Input is added to the list of applications and installed after confirming on the next tab – 

Confirm.

Opening the 'ELOsi administration' interface 

You can reach the ELO Smart Input administration interface in two ways:

1. 

2. 

• 

6 ELO Smart Input



Via Server modules in the ELO Administration Console 

Fig.: Opening the administration interface via the ELO Administration Console

Via the ELOis status page. You will find the ELOsi Administration button at the top right. 

Fig.: ELOsi status, 'ELOsi Administration' button

Differences between version 20 and 21 

The names of the content types have changed between these two versions. They should

automatically be updated on start-up. If you encounter any problems, check to make sure the

different mappings are correct.

The format of the file for the addresses has also changed compared with ELO 20. A header has

been added. If you use your own files for addresses, update them and add them to the header. The

new format also uses the TABULATOR key as a separator, but the separator ";" is also compatible,

meaning that only the header should be added (with the TABULATOR key or ";" including the

exclamation point).

Upgrading from version 12 to version 21 

When installing ELO Smart Input using the ELO 21 Server Setup, a previous ELO Smart Keywording

installation with ELO 12 is not recognized.

Follow the steps below before starting the ELO 21 Server Setup for this reason.

7 ELO Smart Input



Uninstall ELO Smart Keywording: 

On the Tomcat administration page, click undeploy next to SK.

If the former module was not uninstalled completely (may be the case with earlier

versions): 

Stop Tomcat.

In the folder <elo-tomcat-dir>/webapps, delete the file sk.war and the folder sk.

Delete the folder <elo-tomcat-dir>/config/sk.

Install ELO Smart Input using the ELO Server Setup.

Restore the old configuration: 

In ELO, rename the Administration/ELOsk Base folder Administration/ELOsi Base.

If data tables were configured in ELO Smart Keywording, copy them to the new ELO

Smart Input data directory.

Restart ELO Smart Input.

Delete the tiles in the ELO Smart Input administrative area and create them again.

Enable full text 

For quick document processing, the relevant documents should already be filed to ELO and added

to the full text database. For this to work, you will have to enable the Add to full text database

option in the configuration for the pertinent metadata form in the ELO Administration Console.

Fig.: ELO Administration Console, 'Add to full text database' option

ELO Textreader has to be running for full text to work. Check the status in the browser:

Information

You can also use ELO Smart Input without configuring this option. However, this would result

in drastic delays, as OCR processing would be used instead.

<server name>:<Port>/<repository name>/tr?__cmd__=status

9 ELO Smart Input



Configuration 

ELO Smart Input is configured for Germany by default. Some settings can be customized for use in

other countries. These country-specific settings are made in the installation path and require you to

restart ELO Smart Input.

Addresses 

The SI package is supplied with German addresses as standard. You will find this CSV file in the

folder /addresses/. There, you can add additional files as address databases. Multiple files can be

added. Make sure that these files are always UTF-8 encoded and that they have the same header.

Please note

The format of the file for addresses changed between version 20 and 21.

Street names are abbreviated (Tübinger Str.) or written out (Tübinger Straße). There is another

setting in the config.properties for this:

If you work with English addresses, for example, you should change it as follows:

These settings are case-insensitive and only one abbreviation is possible.

To find out whether the street number is expected before the street name, which is common in

some countries, you can use this setting:

Date format 

Dates are recognized in various formats, including as text such as "1 January 2021". By default,

German and English written date values are recognized.

If you want French and Italian date values to be recognized, adjust the config.properties as

follows:

# Default values

streetShort = str.

streetLong = straße

streetShort = st.

streetLong = street

# Default

streetAfterHouseNumber = false

10 ELO Smart Input



We recommend keeping the list of recognized languages to a minimum.

VAT 

ELO Smart Input can recognize values such as the gross amount, net amount, and VAT provided

they comply with the valid VAT rates. The German VAT rates are configured by default. For other

languages, you can make changes via <elo-si-config-path>/config.properties.

Please note

In version 20, this variable was called vatPercents and has been renamed taxes in version

21.

If there is a VAT of zero percent in the country, you will also have to enter 0.

Restricting options 

If you want more or fewer results to be offered in the interface, you can use this setting:

Resetting the classifier 

Sometimes metadata forms change, or you may want to file documents differently, for example

because certain requirements have changed.

In such a situation, it may be beneficial to reset the classifier so that the configured form is no

longer offered.

To reset the classifier, proceed as follows:

Stop ELO Smart Input.

Delete the raw data model files (document word statistics) under <elo-sk-data>/classifier*.

Restart ELO Smart Input.

You can disable the classifier if you don't want it for some reason:

Edit the file <elo-sk-config>/config.properties.

Add classify = false.

datesLanguages = fr, it

# Valid taxes in %

taxes = 5, 7, 16, 19

# The maximum number of alternatives offered

choicesLimit = 4

12 ELO Smart Input



Metadata mapping 

Metadata mapping 

From the standpoint of the software, a field in the metadata is simply a data type, such as text. ELO

Smart Input first has to define what should be allocated to the field (e.g. e-mail, street name, IBAN).

This is done via mapping. In the bar on the left in the Metadata mapping area, you will see a list of

available metadata forms. To define a mapping, select a metadata form.

Fig.: Metadata mapping

In the example above, the first four fields (fax, telephone, e-mail, IBAN) are individual fields. The

last four fields (name, street, city, country) are group fields. The child entries of the group (in Fig. 

Metadata mapping the Address group) belong together. If you select a child entry, all relevant child

entries of the group are filled in.

There are two group fields defined in ELO Smart Input: addresses and sums. Both group fields have

a limited number of child fields.

In the Filing path field, you can define where documents with metadata are filed. For this path, you

can use constants or variables from the metadata.

If no fields are defined for a metadata form, you can generate a mapping for all contained fields by

clicking Create all form fields.

Alternatively, you can click Add value and Add group of values to create your own mappings.

In the Name area you will see the field name followed by the corresponding field template.

In the Contents area, select the relevant pattern. ELO Smart Input recognizes several predefined

patterns, which you can select from the drop-down menu.

13 ELO Smart Input



Preconfigured patterns 

ELO Smart Input recognizes the following patterns by default:

Addresses 

Germany-wide

Amounts 

Everything with two decimal points

Gross, net, and VAT are recognized

Date values 

In different forms (06/21/2021 or June 21, 2021)

German and English formats as standard

16 ELO Smart Input



Regular expressions 

Basics 

On the Contents tab, you can add custom regular expressions to enable ELO Smart Input to

recognize additional patterns. Once the regular expression has been created, you can select it in

the Metadata mapping area. Multiple patterns may have the same name. This allows you to use

multiple different regular expressions for recognition such as https?://.+ and www\..+ as a URL

pattern for a pattern name.

Fig.: 'Contents' tab: example regular expressions

In the Name area, enter a name for the pattern.

In the Regular expression area, you enter the regular expression.

If you only want to filter a portion of the defined regular expression, you can restrict it via the 

Transformation field. If you enter $1 as shown on the 'Contents' tab: example regular expressions

for example, only the content of the first bracket is taken over.

Clicking the Test button opens the Tester dialog box.

17 ELO Smart Input



Fig.: 'Tester' dialog box for testing regular expressions

Here, you can test the defined regular expression. Enter an example text to the input field. The

results of the regular expression search are shown below the input field.

Defining multiple regular expressions for a content type 

It is also possible to configure multiple regular expressions per content type. We will illustrate this

based on an example.

Scenario 

The product IDs allow for an old format 123-456-678 and a new format ABC/123/XYZ.

Method 

Instead of writing a complex regular expression to match both, you can define both formats

separately.

Name Regular expression

product_id \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}

product_id [A-Z]{3}/\d{3}/[A-Z]{3}

Everything matching the defined regular expressions is considered a valid product_id.

18 ELO Smart Input



Extending preconfigured content types with regular expressions 

Existing content types can be extended, see the following example.

Scenario 

By default, the content type credit_card can only recognize normal credit card numbers such as 

1234-1234-1234-1234. However, you want to recognize masked credit card numbers as well, such as

1234-1234-1234-XXXX.

Method 

To enable this, you can add a regular expression also named credit_card such as:

Name Regular expression

credit_card \d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-XXXX

The content type credit_card would find two variants:

1234-1234-1234-1234 (default)

1234-1234-1234-XXXX (additional definition)

Please note

Group content types such as addresses or data sets cannot be extended with regular

expressions.

• 

• 

19 ELO Smart Input



Data sets 

One typical scenario is searching for specific data in a document that cannot be identified by a

regular expression, but instead by an external data source. Examples include project IDs, reference

numbers, and customer names. With ELO Smart Input, you can integrate external data sources and

use them to find IDs and add metadata.

Import CSV/TSV file 

On the Data tab, you can add your own data sets for ELO Smart Input. Click Upload file to upload as

many data sets as you'd like.

The file has to be a *.tsv (tab-separated values) or *.csv (comma-separated values) file. Note the

following:

The first line should be the header, which contains the column names (without whitespaces,

without special characters).

The file must be UTF-8 formatted.

The first column is added as the index as default to be able to search in the document.

Example data set from generated random data:

If the document contains 3D4PG4FB1BT562959 for example, it will be found. Values such as Ford or 

1992 are also offered as additional information for the metadata.

Import via SQL database 

You can also import data sets from an SQL database. In the Data area, click Import from SQL

database.

There, you then have to enter the URL to the JDBC database, for example:

jdbc:sqlserver://<db-server>:1433;databaseName=testdb

jdbc:postgresql://<db-server>:5432/testdb

jdbc:db2://<db-server>:50000/testdb

jdbc:oracle:thin:@<db-server>:1521/testdb.localdomain

After clicking Import from SQL database, the snapshot is copied in full.

You can use any SQL statement. It is transferred directly to the database and the results are

imported.

The first column is added as the index as default to be able to search in the document, independent

of the database indexes.

Searching for multiple columns at once 

Sometimes, you may need to search for another column or multiple columns at once in the

document.

With CSV/TSV files, this can be done by placing an exclamation point before the column name.

Example 

You want to know what car the document is about. The brand, model, and year of manufacture

should be recognized in the document to identify the car. The file would then look as follows:

You can then identify the associated ID or keywords.

You can do the same thing in SQL imports. There, you have to enter the indexes in the last field.

In the example recognizing the car, this would look as follows, without an exclamation point:

Use data set 

Once you have added a data set to ELO Smart Input, you can select it on the Metadata mapping tab

and add it to a metadata form. There is no need restart.

Is there an option to perform automatic/regular updates? 

Not currently. This is planned for a future version, however.

Are there any size limits? 

No. The search is optimized and should also work fine with large volumes of data.

24 ELO Smart Input



Troubleshooting 

ELO Smart Input is slow 

Check whether the documents processed by ELO Smart Input have been added to the full text. If

the documents are not in the full text, the system falls back to OCR.

Client error: HTTP Status 400 – bad request 

The ELO Indexserver proxy setting contains a faulty URL or the ELO Indexserver was not restarted.

Client error: HTTP Status 401 - unauthorized 

To show this web app in the ELO Java Client and ELO Web Client, you have to configure forwarding

via a proxy URL. Check whether the URL in the proxyURL line leads to the status page. If this isn't

the case, check the proxy configuration and restart the ELO Indexserver.

25 ELO Smart Input



Fig.: ELOsi status, 'proxyURL'

Client error: HTTP Status 404 – not found 

The ELO Indexserver proxy setting is missing or the ELO Indexserver was not restarted.

Client error: HTTP Status 503 – service unavailable 

On the Tomcat status page, check whether the si web app is running.

Open the ELO Application Server overview page in your browser: <server name>:<port>/
