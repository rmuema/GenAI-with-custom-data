ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for

Customer

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to set up the ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for

Customer. SAP® Cloud for Customer groups multiple functional levels. This integration works for

SAP Sales Cloud as well as SAP Service Cloud.

The integration service provides the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Client

in an SAP® Cloud for Customer system (referred to here simply as C4C). Following installation, the

ELO Integration Client is available as a mashup in correspondingly configured objects in the C4C

client. When the ELO Integration Client is called within C4C, a configurable path is created

(assuming one doesn't already exist) and displayed in ELO. This provides the user with the

functions of the ELO Integration Client, which can also be customized if required.

ELO basics 

To use the ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for Customer and the ELO Integration Client

within C4C, the systems must meet the following requirements:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 or higher

The following modules are required: 

ELOwf 

ELOwf 20.05.000

ELOwf 12.06.000

ELO REST 

ELO REST Service 20.02.000

ELO REST API 12.04.000

ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.07.000 or higher

Correctly set SameSite flag (see ELO Integration Client documentation)

Installed and configured ELOauth plug-in (optional when using single sign-on)

In addition, your ELO license must include the ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for Customer

as well as user licenses for the ELO Integration Client.

Mashup basics 

A mashup is a website or application that integrates data or functionalities from two or more

sources.

In this case, C4C is the data source and the ELO Integration Client delivers the additional

functionality. Data in C4C is transferred to the ELO Integration Client using a proprietary

implementation.

Configuration in ELO 

First, you need to install and configure the ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for Customer in

the ELO system.

You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration. The ELO

installation package contains the following files:

crm.c4c.integrationservice

crm.c4c.integrationservice.custom

The ELO Integration Client also requires a configuration file in ELOapps:

elo.integration.Client

'elo.integration.client' configuration file 

The configuration file elo.integration.client in JSON format is required for the ELO Integration Client.

You will find this configuration file under this path:

//Administration// ELOapps//Configuration//elo.integration.Client

If this file already exists, you will have to add the entry c4c.

If it does not yet exist, create it with the following parameters. This is important for calling the

URL.

• 

• 

• 

{

  "c4c": {

    "noForm": false,

    "noFeed": false,

    "noFulltext": false,

    "noImagePreview": false,

    "rFInit": "RF_crm_c4c_integrationservice_service_Init",

    "newDocVersFct": true,

    "saveDocFct": true,

    "gotoFct": true,

    "webClientURL": " http(s)://<ELOSERVER>:<PORT>/ix-<REPOSITORY>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/web/"

    "editInOfficeFct": true,

    "removeEntryFct": true,

    "startWorkflowFct": false,

    "startWorkflowTemplates": null,

    "externalLinkFct": true,

    "folderMask": "<GUID of folder form>",

    "documentMask": "<GUID of document form>",

    "hasSearch": true,

4 ELO for SAP Solutions



For more information on this configuration file, refer to the ELO Integration Client manual.

Be sure to check the following important parameters when creating or modifying the file:

rFInit: Function that creates the folder path in ELO; provided with the 

crm.c4c.integrationservice package.

webClientURL: URL to open the ELO Web Client when the GoTo function is enabled. To prevent

the user from having to log on multiple times, the proxy behind the ELO Indexserver must be

configured. The ELO Web Client should be configured accordingly as a plug-in behind the

ELOix proxy (recommended method).

folderMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service uses to create new

structures based on the C4C object.

documentMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service uses when filing

documents from the ELO Integration Client within C4C. You can use metadata forms that pass

information onto the objects.

ELO Integration Service for SAP® Cloud for Customer configuration 

Once you have successfully installed the ELO packages, you will find the configuration app in

the ELO Administration Console under:

Solutions > SAP® Cloud for Customer > ELO Integration Service

    "referenceEntryFct": true,

    "refreshFct": true

  }

}

The ELO for SAP® Cloud for Customer page opens.

Click the ELO Integration Service tile.

The ELO Integration Service configuration interface opens.

Optional:

You can make the following configurations in the interface:

General settings

Structure and metadata matching

Assignment of user and group rights

General settings 

Under General settings, you can now create configurations for each C4C object. As soon as you add

a new entry, corresponding lines are automatically created in the Structures and metadata

matching area. Lines are also created in the Assignment of user and group rights area.

Port binding: In the Port binding column, enter the name of the object you are creating the

configuration for. You can specify the name of the port binding object in the corresponding C4C

mashup (See section URL mashup).

Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that may

have to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.

Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column, e,g. C4C Folder.

Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use when filing from C4C. You

can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client configuration file, or a separate one for

each C4C object.

Structure and metadata matching 

As described in the section General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, a

separate entry for the port binding is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching

area.

Port binding: This entry is copied directly from the Port binding column under General settings and

can also only be modified in this area.

Repository path: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository path column. In this field, you

can also enter C4C variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax. You can find an example in the section 

HTML mashup.

ELO field matching: Choose between GRP for metadata field and MAP for map fields.

ELO field: In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the technical

name.

7 ELO for SAP Solutions



Please note

If the metadata fields do not exist in the metadata form, the corresponding values will be

lost and written as a warning in the log. This means they cannot be imported or matched.

Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELO

entry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curly

brackets.

If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.

Please note

If an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenated

in this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.

Key field: You can select one key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a property of the

object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example, you can

specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. This ensures that an object is not created twice

(with a new name) in the repository, for example. Instead, the corresponding folder is found and a

new path is created according to the new name. The folder and its contents are moved to this new

path. The documents that were stored under the old name remain in the folder with the new name.

Assignment of user and group rights 

This is where you assign user and group rights.

Replace rights: ELO inherits the rights of the folder by default. If this option is enabled, the rights of

the folder are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.

Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.

RWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.

R = View

W = Change metadata

D = Delete

E = Edit

L = Edit list

P = Set permissions

Integration with SAP® Cloud for Customer 

SAP® Cloud for Customer is an SAP CRM product that combines the two SAP customer experience

solutions SAP Sales Cloud and SAP Service Cloud in one package. It runs on the SAP® HANA Cloud

Platform and was developed with a mobile-first approach to meet the current needs of sales and

service users.

ELO Digital Office GmbH does not act in a consulting capacity on SAP® Cloud for Customer, which

is why this documentation only addresses the integration of the ELO Integration Client.

User roles/Views 

You should first check whether you have the required permissions to integrate and configure

mashups.

Please note

The views PDI_DEVELOPMENT and PDI_ADMINISTRATION must not be assigned, as you will

otherwise not have access to the mashup integration functions.

10 ELO for SAP Solutions



After you log on again, the following entries should be available under Administration > General

Settings:

Mashup Web Services

Mashup Authoring

The following entries should be available under your user profile:

Start Adaptation

• 

• 

• 

11 ELO for SAP Solutions



Enable adaptation settings 

Before you can integrate mashups, the function needs to be activated using an administrator

account.

You will find these settings under your user profile > Settings > Adaption Settings.

Please note

If these settings are switched off, you won't be able to adapt the C4C settings or connect the

ELO Integration Client.

Create the mashup application 

To create a C4C mashup, navigate to the following menu entry:

Administrator > General Settings > Mashup Authoring

1. 

12 ELO for SAP Solutions



Select the function New.

You can choose between two mashup types to connect the ELO Integration Client.

URL Mashup: A mashup that sends data from the SAP cloud solution to the URL of an

online service provider. The service provider uses the data to perform a search, for

example. The results are displayed in a new browser window.

HTML Mashup: A mashup that embeds an HTML or JavaScript browser page directly on

a screen.

URL and HTML mashup examples

13 ELO for SAP Solutions



1 URL mashup: Only a URL is displayed. The ELO Integration Client opens in a separate window.

2 HTML mashup: The ELO Integration Client is embedded in the application and opens directly in

the view.

Set up the mashup 

This section explains how a mashup can be created, which configuration steps are required, and

how it is subsequently linked to a C4C object.

The implementation example here was done with a URL mashup as well as an HTML mashup.

Information

Both the URL mashup and the HTML mashup can be configured to enable single sign-on. To

use single sign-on, the URL to the ELOauth plug-in has to be entered instead of the ELO

Integration Client URL. See also the section Single sign-on via ELOauth plug-in.

The following example illustrates implementation without single-sign on.

14 ELO for SAP Solutions



URL mashup 

Select a port binding type.

Information

The port binding type specifies which object data can be accessed in C4C. Not every

object provides a port binding.

Click the icon in the Port Binding text field.

The Port Binding menu opens.

1. 

2. 

15 ELO for SAP Solutions



Information

The port binding options ensure that information from the C4C application is

forwarded to the respective mashup. In turn, the mashup can work with data from the

C4C application.

In the example, a mashup is created for the metadata form Customer (Account).

In this case, the import fields you see in the screenshot will be provided to the C4C

application.

Information

If the field you require is not in the list, you are unable to import or export the data.

Complete the mandatory fields in the General Information menu.

Mashup Name: Specify a name for the mashup.

URL:

Extract parameters: Reads the parameters of the passed URL and displays them in the

request parameter.

Request parameter: This is where the port binding data is mapped to the URL

parameters.

In this case, the parameters debug, system, and ObjType are fixed constants. C4C

dynamically passes the parameter AccountName, which contains the respective

customer name in the AccountName parameter binding.

Click Activate.

HTML mashup 

You can also create an HTML mashup of the type URL. The settings and restrictions correspond to

those described in the URL mashup section.

Configuration based on the example 'Account' 

Display the mashup 

Now that the mashup is configured, it needs to be displayed on the screen.

Navigate to the corresponding object that you want to integrate the mashup into.

If you want to use an existing tab, click the blue button next to the tab.

Alternative:

To create a new tab specifically for your mashup, select Add.

4. 

19 ELO for SAP Solutions



You can rearrange the tab order with drag and drop.

Next, you can enter a name for the new tab.

20 ELO for SAP Solutions



Navigate to the new tab and click the pen icon.

The view on the right-hand side changes to the Form Pane page.

Click twice on the arrow icon to the left of ELO Mashup ‒ Form Pane.

The View page opens.

5. 

6. 

21 ELO for SAP Solutions



Click Add.

You see all mashups that you can use for the object.

Select the mashup you want.

Click Apply to confirm.

7. 

8. 

9. 

22 ELO for SAP Solutions



The mashup is now available.

Please note

If your mashup isn't in the list, it was either created with the wrong port binding or the

corresponding port binding does not exist.

The entry is only selected if the check box is selected.

If you just select an entry, you will get an error message.

Single sign-on via ELOauth plug-in 

If you authenticate with your C4C via SAML authentication, you can also use it for authenticating

with the ELO Integration Client.

In this case, you have to install the ELOauth plug-in and configure it accordingly. You can download

the ELOauth plug-in on the ELO SupportWeb. The installation process is described in ELOauth plug-

in: configuration.

Please note

https://docs.elo.com/admin/config/en-us/elo-indexserver/eloauth-plugin/configuration.html#saml


Only the required ELO settings are shown here. SAML authentication must already be

configured in C4C.

The plug-in is configured using a JSON file named de.elo.ix.plugin.auth.json located in the ELO

Indexserver configuration directory:

Add the following entry to the ELOauth plug-in configuration file and store your required values.

Replace the URL entry for the ELO Integration Client within the mashup with the ELOauth plug-in

URL.

Example structure:

<id> stands for the ID/name of the configuration entry.

<ELO-Inst>/config/ix-<repository>/<server name>

http://<ELOSERVER>:<PORT>/ix-<REPOSITORY>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.auth/login/?configId=<id>
