ELO SAP® OLE call

Introduction 

This documentation describes options for configuring documents or their folders filed in ELO to be

shown from within an SAP transaction (e.g. attachment list).

The ELO Java Client provides a COM interface for direct communication with the SAP GUI. The

following describes installation, configuration, and SAP customizing in order to be able to make an

ELO Java Client call via the SAP system with OLE.

This implementation has been released for the following ELO Java Client versions:

10.09, 11.03, as well as all ELO 12 and ELO 20 versions

ELO Business Solutions Common 1.04.000 and higher

Basics 

Displaying a document in the ELO Java Client requires the standard ArchiveLink tables TOA01, 

TOA02, TOA03, or TOAHR to contain an entry for the document in the SAP system.

In ELO, the SAPPATH field in the metadata form is used for saving for the linked document.

SAPPATH schema: <Repository>/<Archive-Doc-Id>/<Container>

This SAPPATH contains all information from the SAP system and the link tables:

<Repository>: SAP content repository, e.g. E1

<Archive-Doc-ID>: SAP doc ID, e.g. 2FC6BF4CB7D98B6BE1000000253D3A73

<Container>: data or document depending on customizing

To call the ELO Java Client, ELO Business Solutions Common package 1.04 or higher also has to be

installed.

SAP customizing 

Application Maintenance 

To call the ELO Java Client, you have to configure a custom application for ArchiveLink. Open

Application Maintenance with transaction OAA4.

Create a new application using the document icon here.

The administrator is responsible for naming the application. We recommend naming the

application ELOJCLIENT.

After you create the application, it appears in the list of available applications.

Select the new application to customize its settings. Double-click to open the Application

Maintenance area.

In the maintenance area, double-click and select the Display Stored Document entry.

The script and command area will now open.

3. 

4. 

5 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



At this point, this system requires a physical application name. The administrator is once

again responsible for naming the application. In our example, the application was named

after the ELO system.

Enter the command in the line below. Select the object method M.

Application name: ELO.ENTERPRISE

Object methods: M

Command: runScriptFunction eloComViewDocFromSap,@URL

Please note

The Release generated object after call check box must be enabled.

Exit the Application Maintenance area by selecting the Back button.

Save your settings by selecting the floppy disk icon on the toolbar or by pressing CTRL+S.

The status of the Display Stored Document function is shown as Maintained.

You can now exit the Application Maintenance area.

Command – awaitLogin 

Information

The awaitLogin command is available in ELO Java Client versions 10.09, 11.03, and higher

as well as all ELO 12 and ELO 20 versions.

If a user double-clicks and selects a document in the attachment list before starting the ELO Java

Client, the ELO Java Client logon dialog box is shown. Once the user has logged on to ELO, the

default start screen is displayed in the ELO Java Client, and not the selected document. This is

because ELO loses the information for opening the document when starting the logon process. After

logging on, the user has to double-click the document in the attachment list again. To prevent this,

you can add the command awaitLogin. Add this to the M object method in the Application

Maintenance.

Please note

If awaitLogin is added, the SAP frontend client SAP GUI waits for the user to log on to the

ELO Java Client, blocking the SAP session.

Creating protocols 

The next step in customizing SAP is to create a custom protocol.

Open transaction OAA3 – ArchiveLink: Communications Interface Administration.

Click the document icon to create a new protocol for ELO.

Protocol: ELOJC

Version: 0046 (must match the OAC0 entry)

Description: ELO Java Client

In the Version field, enter the version of the SAP ArchiveLink communications protocol.

If you do not know it, check the version in the transaction OAC0 and the respective content

repository.

Confirm your input by selecting the button with the green check mark and save your settings.

Maintaining protocols 

The new protocol now appears in the list of available protocols.

To maintain the protocol, double-click the entry ELOJC.

The application maintenance for the ELOJC protocol opens.

Double-click the Display Stored Document function.

The list of document types for the Display Stored Document function opens.

To open the ELO Java Client for all document types, select the top entry with *. It currently

has the status Not maintained explicitly (standard). Double-click to open the maintenance

window for all document types.

In the Communication Type field, enter OPEN.

In the Application field, enter the new ELOJCLIENT application you created.

Confirm your input by clicking the button with the green checkmark and save your settings.

The document type * is now shown with the status Maintained explicitly.

Protocol – assigning a content repository 

As the final step in customizing ArchiveLink, now assign the new protocol to the content repository

linked to ELO.

Switch to transaction OAC0 – Display Content Repository and double-click the relevant

content repository to select it.

Now, click the icon to switch to change mode for the transaction and enter the new protocol 

ELOJC to the Protocol field.

Save your input with the Save button or by pressing CTRL+S.

ELO – Installation and implementation 

The basis for technical implementation of the scripts is the ELO Business Solutions Common 1.04

package (or higher). If this has not been installed in your ELO system, install it now. This package

provides the class framework, namespaces, and architectural concepts for services, actions, and

function modules.

To start installation, log on to the ELO Java Client as Administrator.

You can install the individual packages from the ELO SupportWeb with a single click.

Alternative: You can download the package containing the .eloinst files on the ELO

SupportWeb.

Then, install the erp.sap.comaccess package.

You will now find the configuration and scripts for the SAP OLE call in the Business Solutions

folder in the ELO repository.

How the script works 

The implemented ELO script searches for a document with data from SAP (content repository,

document ID, and container) as an entry in the SAPPATH field via ELO Indexserver call. The search

string follows this pattern: <contRep>/<docID>/data.

If the script finds hits for this search string, the document is shown depending on the number of hits

and filing location.

If there is exactly one hit, the document is shown in the folder structure. If multiple hits are found

or one document is "only" located in the chaos folder, the ELO Java Client search opens and the

document(s) is (are) shown there.

If there are no hits with …./data, the script performs a new search with the container …./data1. This

method corresponds to the ArchiveLink protocol method for the get method call.

If this search is unsuccessful, another search is run with …./*.

Function test – script without SAP 

To test the function of the script without direct SAP access, you can use the attached testView-

woSap.vbs file.

Assign this script the content repository and document ID for a document filed to your ELO that

contains this information in the SAPPATH, and run the script.

Creating links from the ELO Intray 

With this function, you can file documents in the ELO Intray from within an SAP transaction and link

them to the corresponding SAP business object.

Information

This function is available in ELO Java Client versions 10.07, 11.02, and higher as well as all

ELO 12 and ELO 20 versions.

To configure this, go to transaction OAA4 in your SAP system and select the ELOJCLIENT entry

you created before (see chapter Application Maintenance).

A menu opens.

Select the item Archive from Frontend.

Next, create the following entries Application Maintenance area. Note the correct object

methods (M – S – G).

Application name: ELO.ENTERPRISE

Object methods Command

M runScriptFunctionEx eloComCheckDti,@DTI

G @DTI=getLastScriptResult

M runScriptFunctionEx eloComGetStoreError,@UID

G @ETX=getLastScriptResult

G @EID=getLastScriptResult

M runScriptFunctionEx eloComStoreDoc,@AID

G @DID=getLastScriptResult

M runScriptFunctionEx eloComGetStoreError,@UID

G @ETX=getLastScriptResult

G @EID=getLastScriptResult

Please note

The Release generated object after call check box must be enabled.

Exit the Application Maintenance area by selecting Back.

Save your settings by selecting the the floppy disk icon on the toolbar or by pressing

CTRL+S.

The status of the Archive from Frontend function is shown as Maintained.

You can now exit the Application Maintenance area.

The permitted file format from the ELO Intray depends on the file type selected in SAP as well as

the linked document type. It can be maintained in transaction OAC2.

Please note

If a document with document type FAX or TIF is maintained, only the file extensions TIF and 

TIFF are accepted for filing in ELO. For all other document types, the extension must match

that of the selected document type.

Information and tips 

This chapter contains additional useful information. You will learn how to disable security

information in the SAP GUI.

Security information in the SAP GUI 

When opening a document using the ELO Java Client from in SAP, a security prompt may appear in

the SAP GUI, depending on how the local SAP GUI is configured.

By selecting the button Allow, you enable the function to upload a document.

Check the box next to Remember My Decision to prevent the message from appearing again.

However, the security prompt is transaction-dependent in this case: If the user opens a document

from within another transaction, the security prompt will appear again. The local system

administrator can choose between two SAP GUI settings to disable the message.

Open the Options menu item for your SAP logon menu by clicking the menu icon.

14 ELO Suite for SAP ArchiveLink® (SAP NetWeaver® & SAP S/4HANA®)



On the left side of the open dialog box, select Security > Security Settings. Now, you can

choose one of the three status options.

Information

Status option Strict Deny blocks use of ELO functions.

Security module – 'Disabled' status 

If you set the status to Disabled, no security check is performed when calling the ELO Java Client.

The security prompt is therefore also disabled and no longer shown to the user.

Security module – 'Customized' status 

Once you have set the status to Customized, you can adjust other settings by selecting the Open

Security Configuration button.

If you set Remember my Decision to disable the previous security prompt, the security

configuration will already contain entries.

The elo.enterprise.1 entry stands for calling the ELO Java Client within a transaction in SAP. This

entry is transaction-independent.

Double-click it to see the entry details.

To open/call the ELO Java Client for all transactions, enter an asterisk (*) in place of the

values specified in the Transaction, Screen Na, and Screen Num table fields.

Information

The settings made here depend on the system and client. If needed, they can also be

replaced with an asterisk (*).

If these two settings have been made, the security prompt is no longer shown to the SAP GUI user.

Deleting these entries restores the state on initial installation.
