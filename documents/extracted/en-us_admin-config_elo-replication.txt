ELO Replication

Getting started 

You will find an overview of configuring ELO Replication at two locations here. Follow the links for

more detailed information about the individual steps.

Overview: Configuring replication at two locations 

To configure ELO Replication at at least two locations, perform the following steps:

1. Install at location 1 and location 2.

Install ELO Replication at both locations using the ELO Server Setup on the Applications tab.

2. Configure location 1.

Open your browser and go to the ELO Application Server overview page.

To open the configuration, click /rp.

Log on to ELO Replication with the Apache Tomcat user data.

Choose a location name.

Once you have set your location, draft mode opens.

4 Configuration and administration



Fill out the fields accordingly.

Click the plus icon in the Repositories area to add a repository. A replication set is

automatically created for each repository, which you can assign to an entry in the ELO Java

Client or the ELO Web Client.

Under Scheduler for automatic transfer, define when to export data from the repository.

Please note

The specified interval time refers to the local time of the respective server. All servers

hosting repositories involved in replication must be in sync in terms of time for the

comparison via timestamp to work.

Please note

The scheduler calculates in hours. For example,Â if you enter a time from 8:00 a.m. to

6:00 p.m., replication begins at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 6:59 p.m.

5 Configuration and administration



In the drop-down menu you will find the preconfigured intervals Default and Import only, as

well as all intervals you have created. To create new intervals or change existing ones, click

the pencil icon.

The Scheduler for automatic transfer menu opens. Clicking the plus icon adds a new

schedule. Clicking the eraser icon deletes a schedule.

The input options Simple and Expert are available for the scheduler for automatic transfer.

With the input option Simple, you can choose from default intervals and customize them.

With the input option Expert, you can control the scheduler for automatic transfer more

precisely using variables.

3. Publish replication at location 1.

Once you are finished making settings, you can enable replication. In draft mode, click Publish.

Please note

During initial configuration, you will have to publish the configuration at all participating

locations.

4. Send configuration file to location 2.

A configuration file with your settings is created automatically for each location. Download the

configuration file by clicking Download configuration on the overview page. Send the configuration

file to the relevant location. There, the administrator logs on to ELO Replication and uploads the

configuration file.

6 Configuration and administration



5. Insert configuration file at location 2.

Open the configuration via the ELO Application Server overview page and log on to ELO

Replication using the Apache Tomcat user data.

Information

You do not have to enter a location name. The location name from the configuration

file is automatically applied.

Insert the configuration file.

Confirm the location.

7 Configuration and administration



The settings are applied.

6. Publish replication at location 2.

To enable replication, in draft mode, click Publish.

7. Assign replication sets at location 1 and/or location 2.

Once you have published the replication at the participating locations, you have to assign the

individual entries replication sets. Each replication set stands for one repository. The replication set

is a characteristic that you assign to individual repositories in order to replicate them in another

repository. The individual entries to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web

Client using the Assign replication sets function.

8 Configuration and administration



You will find the Assign replication sets functions in Ribbon > Organize > Properties.

Please note

You should log which entries you assign which replication sets.

Please note

Replication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure. To prevent

inheritance, select the Start point for replication option in the Metadata dialog box of the

entry you want to replicate. In the ELO Java Client, this function is only available for folders.

You will find more information in the chapter Replication set inheritance.

Result 

Once you have performed the steps above, the entries are replicated according to your settings in

the configuration.

9 Configuration and administration



Basics 

In the following chapter, you will learn how data synchronization and data transfer work.

Functionality 

ELO Replication compares entries between multiple repositories. The relevant repositories can be

installed at different locations. ELO Replication transfers the data to the relevant repositories. This

means the repositories do not necessarily have to be available to one another.

ELO Replication is a web app based on Java that is installed on an Apache Tomcat.

Replication set 

The replication set is a characteristic that you assign to individual repositories in order to replicate

them in another repository. Create locations and add repositories in the web-based configuration.

Using the ELO Indexserver URL, specify which repositories data is replicated from. A replication set

is created automatically in the configuration when you add a new repository. Each replication set

stands for one repository. The individual entries (folders, documents) to be replicated are selected

in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client using the "Assign replication sets" function. With this

function, you select the repository you want to export the entries to. This means you select a

repository the entries are replicated to.

Data synchronization 

ELO Replication captures, distributes, and transfers changes to the relevant repositories. An

extension to the ELO Indexserver creates a synchronization data set with the changes to a

repository. The format of this data set is a compressed stream of JSON objects from the ELO

Indexserver API. The data in this stream is selected in the ELO Indexserver based on its

synchronization status. The following options are available:

Entries without a replication set: Entries that you do not want to synchronize are not assigned a

replication set. A replication set determines which other repositories the entry is synchronized with.

Entries without a replication set are not added to the synchronization data set.

Entries with a new replication set: Entries that you want to synchronize are assigned new

replication sets. The information from the entries is added to the synchronization data set. All the

entry information is only sent to the repositories assigned the new replication set. If entries have

already been assigned replication sets, their repositories are simply informed that the entries are

now replicated with additional repositories.

The ELO Indexserver assigns replicated entries the tstampsync field when creating the

synchronization data set in the database. The tstampsync field contains the value from the

corresponding tstamp field at the time the data was read from the database. In the synchronization

data set, the tstampsync contains the value it had when the database was read. This difference

plays an important role when importing the data set.

10 Configuration and administration



Information

The name of the tstampsync field varies depending on the table.

Entries changed since the last synchronization: The entries were changed since the last

synchronization. To recognize a change, the tstamp and tstampsync fields are compared. In case of

changes, the ELO Indexserver automatically sets the tstamp field to the current time in UTC

(Coordinated Universal Time).

Entries unchanged since the last synchronization: The entries were not changed since the last

synchronization. For unchanged entries, the values in the tstamp and tstampsync fields are

identical. Unchanged entries are not added to the synchronization data set.

Data transfer 

The synchronization data set is created by the ELO Indexserver. ELO Replication initiates its

creation based on a configured schedule. The synchronization data set is streamed by the ELO

Replication to the other locations, and from there it is streamed to the ELO Replication of the other

repositories so it can be imported. During streaming, the data set is processed between the ELO

Replication instances. Only the data required is sent at the target is sent.

To compensate for instabilities during transmission, ELO Replication caches the data sets. If

disconnected, ELO Replication re-attempts to send the data set once a minute. The data set is

transferred all over again, regardless of when the previous transfer was interrupted.

The SSHD library from the Apache MINA project is used for data transfer. The method with public

and private keys is used exclusively for authentication. The keys are automatically generated for

each location when configuring ELO Replication.

Information

You can add additional options for transferring data by creating and integrating plug-ins.

The ELO Indexserver imports the synchronization data set into the target repository. The following

options are available:

Entry does not exist in repository: The GUID is used to check whether an entry already exists in the

repository. If the entry does not exist in the repository, it is imported.

Entry already exists in the repository and has not changed since the last synchronization: The

values in the tstampsync fields of the synchronization data set and repository entries are identical.

The entry is imported into the repository. The entry in the repository is overwritten with the values

from the synchronization data set.

Entry already exists in the repository and has competing changes: The values in the tstamp fields

of the synchronization data set and repository entries do not match. If an entry has been changed

in multiple repositories, the latest change is applied. If the latest change comes from the target

11 Configuration and administration



repository, the entry in the synchronization data set is ignored. Otherwise, the values of the entry

in the repository would be replaced with the values in the synchronization data set.

In rare cases, the values in the tstampsync fields may differ. This occurs when a synchronization

data set is created in the local repository before the synchronization data set of the other

repository has been read and the entry is changed in both repositories. The latest change is applied

in this case as well.

What data is replicated? 

The following data is synchronized during replication:

Folders

Documents

Sticky notes

Relations

Workflows

Workflow templates

Map data

Feed

Master data: users and groups (via owners and ACLs), metadata forms, aspects, colors,

replication sets

Master data is resolved recursively. For example, if a user is listed in the ACL of a folder, this user's

groups are also included in the synchronization data set.

How is master data replicated? 

During data export, the ELO Indexserver checks which master data belongs to a SORD.

Only users that a SORD explicitly refers to are replicated. If you want to replicate a specific user,

this user has to be referenced by a SORD, e.g. via permissions (Metadata > Permissions) or Owner

rights (Create folder, File document, Apply stamp/annotation, Start workflow).

Please note

If a user is replicated, the groups the user belongs to are also replicated (without the

individual members).

If a group is replicated, for example because it has permission to a SORD, the individual

group members are not replicated.

If a metadata form is replicated, a time stamp is set in the masktstampsync field of the docmasks

table in the database. Metadata forms that have already been replicated are added to the

synchronization data set if changes have been made to the forms.

12 Configuration and administration



How are workflows replicated? 

The following section describes the behavior starting with ELO Indexserver version 21.03.

With the default settings, a workflow can only run in one repository. During data export, the

workflow is assigned a flag indicating which repository it is running in. In the target repository, the

workflow is displayed after replication but it will not continue. You cannot start, edit, or delete the

workflow in the target repository.

To use the workflow in the target repository as well, the flag needs to be changed during export.

This is done with a server transfer node, which is added in the workflow designer. If a server

transfer node is set, the workflows stops at this node. Once the data has been transferred through

replication, the workflow continues in the target repository. The entire workflow including all

subworkflows is always replicated.

Please note

The server transfer can only take place in a main workflow, not in a subworkflow. If you want

to start a subworkflow at location B, the server transfer must take place in the main

workflow at location A. If a group is replicated, for example because it has permission to a

SORD, the individual group members are not replicated.

A subworkflow should only run at one location. You should not start a subworkflow at

location A and continue it at location B, as conflicts that cannot be resolved automatically

can occur if the main workflow and subworkflow are running in different repositories at the

same time.

13 Configuration and administration



Installation 

This chapter explains how to install ELO Replication.

Requirements 

The following requirement must be met for installation:

All servers hosting repositories involved in replication must be in sync in terms of time for the

comparison via timestamp to work.

Please note

The same version of ELO Replication and the ELO Indexserver should be installed at all

locations.

Step by step 

Attention

Replication sets and their assignments in the repository that were created in a version older

than ELO Replication 12 will be deleted when migrating to ELO Replication 21. Before

performing a migration, create an overview of replication sets and their assignments so you

can reconfigure them in version 21.

Information 

Install ELO Replication using the ELO Server Setup on the Applications tab.

Step by step 

Start the ELO Server Setup.

On the Applications tab, click Add ELO Replication.

Select an ELO server you want to install the module to.

14 Configuration and administration



Result 

You have installed ELO Replication.

To open the ELO Replication configuration, open your browser and go to the ELO Application Server

overview page. For more information, refer to the chapter Configuration.

Please note

If you perform an update of the ELO Server Setup to move the ELO Replication module to

another Apache Tomcat server, files from the data folder in the directory <ELO>\data\rp\

<Tomcat of replication site> are not transferred. To ensure that there are no files missing in

the target repository, all files from the old data folder must be moved to the data folder in

the new Tomcat directory.

You need to stop the Apache Tomcat server before you move the files. After restarting the

Tomcat, the configuration is loaded.

If you make changes to the Tomcat, such as adding a new host or changing the ports, you

need to publish the respective configurations in the ELO Replication menu again.

15 Configuration and administration



Configuration 

Create locations and add repositories in the web-based configuration. Using the ELO Indexserver

URL, specify which repositories data is replicated from. A replication set is created automatically in

the configuration when you add a new repository. Each replication set stands for one repository. The

replication set is a characteristic that you assign to individual repositories in order to replicate

them in another repository. The individual entries (folders, documents) to be replicated are selected

in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client using the "Assign replication sets" function. With this

function, you select the repository you want to export the entries to. This means you select a

repository the entries are replicated to.

Attention

Replication sets and their assignments in the repository that were created in a version older

than ELO Replication 12 will be deleted when migrating to ELO Replication 21. Before

performing a migration, create an overview of replication sets and their assignments so you

can reconfigure them in version 21.

To configure ELO Replication for the first time, log on at any location and configure the settings as

desired. These settings are saved in a configuration file. You can send the configuration file to other

locations. This means you only have to configure replication manually at one location.

Overview 

To configure ELO Replication at at least two locations, perform the following steps. For more

information on the individual steps, refer to the chapters Installation and the following sections.

Install at location 1 and location 2.

Configure location 1.

Publish replication at location 1.

Send configuration file to location 2.

Insert configuration file at location 2.

Once you have confirmed the configuration file, draft mode opens. You will see the locations

in the replication network. The settings from the configuration file were applied.

To enable the replication for your location, click Publish.

Result 

The replication sets are created. The SSH port is started.

Next step 

Once you have published the replication at the participating locations, you have to assign the

individual entries replication sets. This means you determine what entries are replicated and

where. For more detailed information, refer to the chapters Assign replication sets and Replication

set inheritance.

Replication set inheritance 

Replication sets are automatically created in the configuration when you add a new repository. Each

replication set stands for one repository. The replication set is a characteristic that you assign to

individual repositories in order to replicate them in another repository. The individual entries

(folders, documents) to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client using

the Assign replication sets function.

Information

4. 

31 Configuration and administration



You only have to assign replication sets at one location. The assigned replication sets are

also configured at the other locations through replication.

Default: Inheritance to parent folder 

Replication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure.

Example: If you assign the folder C including its child entries a replication set, the entries marked

in yellow are replicated. The replication set is inherited to the parent folders.

'Start point for replication' option 

To prevent the replication sets from being inherited to the parent folders, select the Start point for

replication option in the Metadata dialog box of the entry you want to replicate. The Start point for

replication option allows you to replicate parts of repositories that are not filed to identical

repository structures.

Please note

In the ELO Java Client, this function is only available for folders.

Please note

32 Configuration and administration



Enable the Start point for replication option before assigning the entry a replication set.

Example: You have enabled the Start point for replication option for the C folder. If you then assign

the C folder including its child entries a replicated sets, only the folder C and its child entries are

replicated (marked yellow). The replication set is not inherited to the parent folders.

33 Configuration and administration



During the next replication process, the C folder is filed to the following path in the target

repository: // Administration // Replication Base. From there, the administrator moves the folder to

the desired location in the target repository. This only has to be performed during the initial

replication process. The replication remembers the repository structure.

Assign replication sets 

Information 

Replication sets are automatically created in the configuration when you add a new repository. Each

replication set stands for one repository. The replication set is a characteristic that you assign to

individual repositories in order to replicate them in another repository. The individual entries

(folders, documents) to be replicated are selected in the ELO Java Client or ELO Web Client using

the Assign replication sets function. This means you select a repository the entries are replicated

to. The name of a replication set in the ELO client is made up of the location name and the name of

the repository.

Information

The following uses screenshots of the ELO Java Client.

Information

34 Configuration and administration



You only have to assign replication sets at one location. The assigned replication sets are

configured at the other locations through replication.

You will find the Assign replication sets functions in Ribbon > Organize > Properties.

Requirements 

You need the right Assign replication sets. This right is enabled in the ELO Administration Console.

Please note

You should log which entries you assign which replication sets.

Please note

Documents with the status Version control disabled cannot be replicated. You will find the

document status at Ribbon > Organize > Metadata > 'Options' tab.

Step by step 

In the ELO client, select the entry you want to assign a replication set to.

On the ribbon, click Organize > Properties > Assign replication sets.

The Assign replication sets dialog box opens.

35 Configuration and administration



Click Add.

The Add replication set dialog box opens.

You will see all the replication sets defined in the configuration. The name of the replication

set is made up of the location name and the name of the repository.

Information

The local replication set, that is the replication set where the entries are located, is

assigned automatically. You do not have to add it manually.

Select one or more replication sets and confirm with OK.4. 

36 Configuration and administration



The replication sets appear in the Assign replication sets dialog box.

Please note

Replication sets are inherited upward to parent folders in the repository structure. To

prevent inheritance, select the Start point for replication option in the Metadata dialog

box of the entry you want to replicate. In the ELO Java Client, this function is only

available for folders. You will find more information in the chapter Replication set

inheritance.

The following options are available:

Including child entries: If this option is enabled, the replication set is also assigned to the

child entries of the selected entry.

Set: All the listed replication sets are assigned to the entry.

Differences: This option should only be used in combination with the Include child entries

option. Differences: If you removed replication sets from the list and/or added replication

sets to the list, this change is passed on to the entries. Replication sets from the list that

were not changed are not passed on. The replication sets of the entries that were not

changed are retained.

37 Configuration and administration



In the example above, a folder and its child folders have different replication sets. The Assign

replication sets dialog box opens for the folder. The Include child entries option is enabled.

The Blue, Orange, and Pink replication sets are already assigned to the folder. The Green

replication set is added. The Differences option is selected. The Green replication set is

added to the list again. This change is passed on to the folder and its child folders.

Replication sets from the list that were not changed are not passed on. The Blue, Orange, and

Pink replication sets are not assigned again. This means the child folder is not assigned the 

Pink replication set. The replication sets of the entries that were not changed are retained.

Folders and child folders retain their original replication sets and are additionally assigned

the Green replication set.

Cut: The replication sets are assigned to the entry. The replication sets that are not within

this intersection are removed. This option should only be used in combination with the 

Include child entries option. Use the Cut option if, for example, it is unclear due to the set 

Start point for replication which replication sets are assigned to the child entries and you only

want to inherit the replication sets selected in the dialog box. In contrast to the Set option,

with the Cut option you cannot assign any new replication sets. With the Cut function, you

can delete replication sets from child entries that are not contained in the parent entry.

38 Configuration and administration



In the example above, a folder and its child folders have different replication sets. The Assign

replication sets dialog box opens for the folder. The Include child entries option is enabled.

The Blue, Orange, Pink, and Yellow replication sets are already assigned to the folder. The 

Orange replication set is deleted. The Cut option is selected. The replication sets are

assigned. The replication sets that do not overlap between the initial status and the

reassignment are removed. Only the Orange replication set is removed from the folder. With

the child folder, the Orange, Green, and Yellow replication sets do not overlap between the

initial status and the reassignment. For this reason, the child folder is not assigned the Yellow

replication set. The Orange and Green replication sets are removed from the child folder.

Make the desired changes to the settings and confirm with OK.

Result 

You have assigned the selected replication sets. During the next replication process, the selected

entry will be replicated.

Outlook 

You can check the transfer status on the ELO Replication overview page.

39 Configuration and administration



On the overview page, click a location. The transfer overview opens on the right. You will recognize

a replication based on the repository icon in the Type column. Successful transfer is indicated by

two check marks in the Status column. For more information, refer to the chapter Monitoring.

Edit configuration 

Information 

You can edit the configuration of a published replication. During editing, the replication remains

active. To apply your changes to the published replication, click Publish in draft mode.

Information

If you publish a new draft, the changes are automatically applied to all locations. You do not

have to update the configuration manually at the different locations.

If you add a new location, you will have to upload the configuration file at the new location and

publish the replication there. You can find more information in the section Create/insert a

configuration for other locations.

40 Configuration and administration



Step by step 

On the overview page, click Edit draft.

Draft mode opens.

For more detailed information on the configuration settings, refer to the Draft mode

(overview), Location settings, and Scheduler for automatic transfer chapters.

Make the desired changes. Your changes are saved automatically as soon as you leave an

input field.

To end editing, you have the following options:

Publish changes: To apply your changes to the published replication, click Publish.

Discard changes: To delete your changes, click Discard. The published replication is not

changed.

Save draft: If you don't want to publish the new draft yet or want to continue editing it

at a later point in time, exit draft mode by clicking the back arrow or log off. Your draft

is saved automatically. The published replication is not changed. To continue editing,

click Edit draft on the overview page.

Result 

You have edited the replication.

Outlook 

If you've published a new draft, the changes are automatically transferred to all locations. You can

check the transfer status on the ELO Replication overview page.

Monitoring 

You can monitor an active replication using the transfer overview. To open the transfer overview,

click a location on the overview page.

You can manually start an export from the local repository for test purposes. The export starts

immediately, regardless of the configured schedule. Click the Start export (1) button.

In the transfer overview, you see a list of the jobs. Click an entry to open the detailed view.

The following job types are shown in the transfer overview:

Replication: You will recognize a replication job based on the repository icon (2).

Configuration: If you have changed the configuration of an active replication and want to

publish your changes, the changes are automatically transferred to all locations. You will

recognize the transfer of a new configuration based on the gear icons (3).

The following statuses are shown in the transfer overview:

Handling errors 

The following section describes the behavior starting with ELO Indexserver version 21.03.

Error when exporting from the Indexserver: If an error occurs while exporting an item, e.g. because

a document was deleted in the document path, a SORD linking to the item that caused the error is

created in the repository under Administration > Replication Base. The error message is displayed

under Metadata > Extra text.

Errors that prevent an import (to hub or Indexserver): These are errors such as a corrupt replication

package, an unavailable location/Indexserver, or the transfer was aborted. You can recognize errors

like these by the exclamation mark in the Status column of the transfer overview. Click an entry to

open the detailed view. A question mark is displayed next to the status. Click on the question mark

icon to download an error message in JSON format. ELO Replication attempts to send the data set

once every minute. The data set is transferred all over again, regardless of when the previous

transfer was interrupted.

44 Configuration and administration



Errors that prevent an import of individual items (to Indexserver): These are errors such as if the

item dependency is not found, or an item violates rulesets (name too long, user GUID already

assigned). In this case, ELO Replication does not attempt to transfer the data again. The import is

completed and the error is logged. A log icon appears in the Details column of the transfer

overview. Use this icon to open the transfer protocol that lists the errors.

After clicking the protocol icon, the information of the transfer protocol is displayed in the program

interface.
