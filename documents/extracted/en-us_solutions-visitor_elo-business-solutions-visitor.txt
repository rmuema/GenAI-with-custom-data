calendar format.

Dynamic folders: Once a visitor or group has reached a specific deadline, the relevant file is

automatically moved to the corresponding folder.

Visitor lists: You can create lists of visitors who are currently checked in.

Dashboard overview

The dashboard provides an overview of all visitor files, group folders, and their statuses.

You can reach the dashboard by clicking the Visitors and groups tile in the My ELO area.

The dashboard remembers your settings. When you exit then open the dashboard again, it

remembers and displays your most recent view.

Fig.: Dashboard in the table view

The dashboard is divided into the following areas:

1 Database: In the dashboard header, use the drop-down menu (arrow icon) to select a database. A

dashboard database is a list of visitor files and/or group folders that is loaded for evaluation.

Information

If there is only one database, this database is selected permanently and no drop-down

menu is available.

2 Table/Calendar: You can choose between two dashboard views: Table and Calendar.

3 Search: In addition to text values, you can also search for number values. All data that you can

select as column values in the position view serves as the basis.

Information

If you'd like to search for index fields that are not listed on the dashboard, use the general

ELO search.

4 Visitors/Groups: You can either view visitors or groups.

Information

When checking in a group, the group members are created as individual visitors. The

individual group members are therefore shown when you select the visitor view. If you

choose the group view, the groups are only shown with the person responsible.

5 Status: The dashboard header contains a button for each visitor status. If a button is active, all

visitors with the corresponding status are shown in the dashboard viewer pane.

6 Viewer pane: In the dashboard viewer pane, you will see a list of visitor files or group folders.

This list changes depending on the filter criteria applied.

Minimized view

Fig.: Dashboard in minimized view

The dashboard automatically adjusts to the size of the browser window. Here, you see the view

with a narrower width, where you can view either Key figures or Visitor.

1 Menu: You can hide and show the Key figures and Visitor as well as the free text search via the

menu.

2 Key figures: Choose Key figures to view or change the status of the displayed visitors or groups.

3 Visitor: Select Visitor to show the visitors either in a table or calendar.

Contact management

You can save companies and contacts to speed up the process of creating new visitors. If you select

a contact when creating a visitor, the data stored for this contact is automatically entered to the

correct fields.

When creating a visitor, you can save the contact you have entered or use the following functions

on the ribbon via New > Contacts:

New contact list

New company

New contact

Create overview of contacts

To get an overview of your contacts, use the Create overview of contacts function.

Create contact label

Use the Create contact label function to create a label with QR code for the selected contact.

The label is filed to the contact folder.

The label contains information on the contact as well as a QR code. If you print the label using a

label printer and file it to a physical folder, mobile end devices will take you straight to the digital

folder by scanning the QR code.

If you want to use the Print document function in the ELO Java Client, you will have to set the label

printer as the default printer in Windows.

You can also select the label printer as the default printer for faxes in the ELO Java Client

configuration and print using the Fax document function.
