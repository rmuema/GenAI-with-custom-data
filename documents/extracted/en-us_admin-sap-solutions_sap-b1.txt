ELO Integration Service for SAP Business

One®

Introduction 

This documentation describes how to set up the ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One®. It

forms the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Client in an SAP Business One®

system. The ELO Integration Client is available as an additional tab in configured views of the SAP

Business One® client. When called, a configurable path in ELO is generated (if one doesn't already

exist) and shown using the ELO Integration Client. The functions of the ELO Integration Client are

available here and can be customized.

Basics 

To use the ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One® and ELO Integration Client within SAP

Business One®, the systems must meet the following requirements:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 or higher

ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.07.000 or higher

The ELO license must include the ELO Integration Client

SAP Business One® version 10 or higher (64-bit client on Microsoft Windows)

On the computers running the extension: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher

Preconfiguration in ELO 

First, ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One® has to be installed and configured in the ELO

system.

You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration > ELO

for SAP BUSINESS ONE® > ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One®.

erp.sbo.integrationservice

erp.sbo.integrationservice.custom

The ELO Integration Client also requires a configuration file in ELOapps.

elo.integration.Client

'elo.integration.client' configuration file 

The configuration file elo.integration.client in JSON format is required for the ELO Integration Client.

You will find this file in ELO under:

Administration // ELOapps // Configuration

If this file already exists, you will have to add the entry sbo. This is the case if the ELO Integration

Client is already integrated with Salesforce, for example. In this case, multiple profiles are used.

If the file does not exist, create it with the following parameters:

• 

• 

• 

"sbo": {

    "noForm": false,

    "noFeed": false,

    "noFulltext": false,

    "noImagePreview": false,

    "rFInit": "RF_erp_sbo_integrationservice_service_Init",

    "newDocVersFct": true,

    "saveDocFct": true,

    "gotoFct": true,

    "webClientURL": "http://<Server>:<Port>/ix-<Repository>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/web"

    "editInOfficeFct": true,

    "removeEntryFct": true,

    "startWorkflowFct": false,

    "startWorkflowTemplates": null,

    "externalLinkFct": true,

    "folderMask": "<GUID of folder form>",

    "documentMask": "<GUID of document form>",

    "hasSearch": true,

    "referenceEntryFct": true,

4 ELO for SAP Solutions



For more information on this configuration file, refer to the ELO Integration Client manual.

Check the following important functions:

rFInit: Function that creates the folder path; provided with the erp.sbo.integrationservice

package.

webClientURL: To prevent the user from having to log on multiple times, the proxy behind the

ELO Indexserver has to be configured. The ELO Web Client has to be configured as a plug-in

behind the proxy.

folderMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for SAP Business

One® uses to create new structures from within the SAP Business One® object.

documentMask: Defines the metadata form that the ELO Integration Service for SAP Business

One® uses when filing documents from the ELO Integration Client within SAP Business

One®. You can use metadata forms that pass information onto the objects.

Configuring the ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One® 

Once you have successfully installed erp.sbo.integrationservice, you will find the configuration app

in the ELO Administration Console.

    "refreshFct": true

Navigate to the app to view a selection of configurations.

Click the ELO Integration Service tile.

The Structures and folders tab appears.

General settings 

On the Structures and folders tab, you define the paths per object. You can create as many entries

as you want here. Due to their complexity, objects are split into multiple areas:

6 ELO for SAP Solutions



Assignment of user and group rights 

When performing calls, the system always checks from top to bottom. For example, if a certain

object (such as 17 for sales order) is configured first, followed by a wildcard with a regular

expression, the first entry is used when performing a call with object 17. For this reason, you should

make sure to sort entries from specific to general (corresponding buttons).

Default filing path 

Object type: In the Object type column, enter the number of the respective object type in SAP

Business One®.

A general filing path is configured as standard. This path uses the wildcard character .* (period and

asterisk) in the Object type column. The option is RegEx is also enabled. This path handles all

object types that do not have a more specific configuration.

Intermediate form: In the Intermediate form column, enter the metadata form for folders that may

have to be created on storage so that the specified path can be generated.

Folder form: The final metadata form is specified in the Folder form column, e,g. SBO-Folder.

Document form: Reserved for future use cases. The same form should be entered here as in the

ELO Integration Client configuration file.

7 ELO for SAP Solutions



Structure and metadata matching 

Repository path: The filing path is defined in the Repository path column. With Handlebars syntax,

you can use variables from SAP Business One® that are defined for transfer in the advanced

configuration.

ELO field matching: This is where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata form

defined under Folder form. In our example, this is the form SBO-Folder.

Key field: You can select a key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a property of the

object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example, you can

specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. This ensures that an object is not created twice

(with a new name) in the repository, for example. Instead, the corresponding folder is found and a

new path is created according to the new name. The folder and its contents are moved to this new

path. The documents that were stored under the old name remain in the folder with the new name.

Add entry: If necessary, you can add fields. You can enter additional variables with Handlebars

syntax or a static string without additional syntax.

The fields have to be part of the metadata form and are not created automatically. Only the fields

configured on the SAP Business One® configuration tab are available. The following variants are

feasible:

a) The field was configured in the Default fields for transferring object information area.

b) The field was configured in the Configuration of SAP Business One Forms (objects) area in

the Object-specific fields column.

Refer to the Installation in SAP Business One® section for more information.

You can also use map fields.

• 

• 

8 ELO for SAP Solutions



Example 1 

In this example, the objects are filed to the default filing path in Other objects under the variables 

ObjType and DocNum.

Filing path by object type 

If necessary, you can create additional paths with special configurations for individual object types.

Example 2 

Object type: For this documentation, we use object type 17 (sales order).

Intermediate form: As with the default filing path. Folder form: As with the default filing path.

Document form: As with the default filing path.

Repository path:

ELO field matching: As with the default filing path.

/SAP Business One/Sales orders/{{{DocNum}}}

9 ELO for SAP Solutions



In this example, we create a child folder Sales orders in the SAP Business One folder in ELO.

Objects are stored in this folder under the DocNum.

If you request the object-specific fields CardCode and CardName in the advanced configuration for

the order form, you can also build the path as follows:

Assignment of templates, user and group rights 

In this area, you can use a stored template (template structure) when creating an entry as well as

assign user and group rights. The required template can be created in the configuration area of

Business One under

// Administration // Business Solutions Custom // erp.sbo.serviceintegration // Configuration //

FolderTemplates.

The template is only copied the first time the entry is created.

/Business partner/Customer/{{{CardCode}}} - {{{CardName}}}/Orders/{{{DocNum}}}

10 ELO for SAP Solutions



Path to template: Enter the path to the template structure here. For example, if you created a

template structure PurchaseOrder, this would mean that when you call the ELO Integration Client in

the Business One purchase order object, assuming all conditions are met, the structure is created

under

Administration // Business Solutions Custom // erp.sbo.integrationservice // Configuration //

FolderTemplates // PurchaseOrder.

At this point, you must use a separator to define a deeper folder structure. However, the separator

used must be leading, e.g. if you enter /Vendor/Orders, the slash is recognized as a separator.

Handlebars syntax is also allowed, which enables you to control templates flexibly.

If you use Handlebars syntax to create the structure, you can only use metadata from the fields of

the initial template, in this case SBO folder.

Rights for users and groups

Replace rights: ELO takes on the rights of the parent element by default. If the Replace rights option

is enabled, the rights of the parent element are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.

Please note that this function only works if a folder structure does not yet exist.

Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.

RWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.

R = View

W = Change metadata

D = Delete

E = Edit

L = Edit list

P = Set permissions

For more information, refer to the documentation Concept for assigning rights and permissions.

Working with multiple companies/databases 

If you work with multiple companies/databases in SAP Business One®, but manage them in a

single ELO repository, you can configure the Company column.

To show the Company column, you have to enable the Expert mode option.

In the Company column, you enter the technical name of the respective company.

12 ELO for SAP Solutions



You will find it in SAP Business One® under Administration > Choose Company.

Using the Company column, you can define different paths for different databases.

SAP Business One® configuration 

To configure additional settings for ELO for SAP Business One®, switch to the tab SAP Business

One® configuration.

The SAP Business One® configuration tab is divided into multiple areas.

Basic settings 

In the Basic settings area, you will find the fields described below.

13 ELO for SAP Solutions



Title – Integration Client tab: Here, you enter a name for the ELO tab in SAP Business One®.

Integration Client call URL: Here, you enter the ELO Integration Client URL. ELOwf provides the ELO

Integration Client and, like the ELO Web Client, has to be configured behind the proxy server. The

server name and port have to be identical for the call URL and the ELO Web Client URL so that the

logon ticket is applied automatically (SSO).

URL schema:

User relation: In this field, you configure how ELO maps users.

a) Users in ELO and in SAP Business One® have identical names: Select the ELO user name

menu item.

b) Users in ELO and SAP Business One® are not identical: The user name from SAP Business

One® has to be configured in ELO as a user property. In this case, select the corresponding

user property.

14 ELO for SAP Solutions



If ELO is configured with SSO via Kerberos, you can select the option None under User

relation.

In this case, the URL has to be adjusted. Replace /plugin/ with /plugin-auth/.

Default fields for transferring object information 

Here, you can specify which fields can be used for the filing path structure on the Structures and

folders tab. The fields entered here are requested for all forms. Additional fields with a specific

reference to individual forms can be entered under Object-specific fields in the respective form.

Configuring the display 

In the Configuration of SAP Business One Forms (objects) area, you can configure how the

embedded ELO system looks.

15 ELO for SAP Solutions



Forms ID: With the Forms ID field, you can specify the form in SAP Business One® the settings

apply to by entering an ID.

Element ID: With the Element ID field, you can specify the form element in SAP Business One® to

serve as a basis for display by entering an ID.

16 ELO for SAP Solutions



Margin (left, top, etc.): The margin fields allow you configure custom settings for indents and

margins. The values are relative to the element entered in Element ID.

Adjacent tab (left): Enter the ID of the tab to be shown next to the ELO tab.

Object-specific fields: Click Add entry to add fields that will then be available for structuring.

These fields and the corresponding identifiers depend on the type of form selected and have to be

identified first.

In this example, the Customer field has the identifier CardCode.

17 ELO for SAP Solutions



Information

The technical field names are only shown if you have enabled the System Information

option under View.

Calling the ELO Integration Client within an object 

If a new document is created within an object (e.g. a customer offer) in SAP Business One®, the

ELO Integration Client will not be displayed until the corresponding data set has been saved and

18 ELO for SAP Solutions



the offer number can be used as identifier. This is necessary because the temporary ID assigned by

SAP Business One® (e.g. the offer number) could change before the document is stored.

Additional fields for compatibility reasons 

The following fields can be enabled in expert mode:

Display level

UID folder item

UID browser control

Please note

These fields are available for compatibility reasons. Normally, these values do not have to

be changed. However, there may be forms already using the display level. Or, other

extensions may be installed that use the same display level or UID. In these cases, you will

have to make some changes.

ELO Output Link for SAP Business One®

Introduction

This document describes how to set up ELO Output Link for SAP Business One®.

ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One® is required as the foundation for ELO Output Link to

function. This not only forms the technical platform for implementing the ELO Integration Client in

an SAP Business One® system, but also acts as the interface between ELO and SAP Business One®

for the ELO Output Link for SAP Business One®.

Basics

To use ELO Output Link for SAP Business One®, the following system requirements must be met:

ELOprofessional or ELOenterprise version 12 or higher

ELO Business Solutions Common version 1.15.000 or higher

The ELO license must include the ELO Integration Client

SAP Business One® version 10 or higher (64-bit client on Microsoft Windows)

On the computers running the extension: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher

Configured ELO Integration Service for SAP Business One®

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

25 ELO for SAP Solutions



Preconfiguration in ELO 

First, ELO Output Link for SAP Business One® has to be installed and configured in the ELO system.

You will find the necessary installation packages on the ELO SupportWeb under Integration. The ELO

installation package contains the following files:

erp.sbo.outputlink

custom_erp.sbo.outputlink

Configuring ELO Output Link for SAP Business One® 

The configuration is rolled out via the Integration Service package for version 1.00.004 and higher.

This is therefore a requirement.

Like the Integration Service, Output Link includes a sample configuration. This includes the

following objects:

Sales orders

Sales quotations

Delivery notes

Invoices

Credits

Purchase orders

Once you have successfully installed the ELO packages, you will find the configuration app in the

ELO Administration Console under Solutions > ELO for SAP Business One® > ELO Output Link.

Click the ELO Output Link tile to access the configuration interface of ELO Output Link for SAP

Business One®.

26 ELO for SAP Solutions



General settings 

In the General settings area, you define an object type. With customer extensions within SAP

Business One®, this could also be an ID defined by development. The object type helps you

identify the configuration entry.

As soon as you add a new entry in this area, corresponding lines are automatically created in the 

Structures and metadata matching and Assignment of user and group rights areas.

27 ELO for SAP Solutions



Object type: In this column, enter the ID that uniquely identifies an object.

Company: You can enter a company here to distinguish between several companies in use. Multiple

entries can exist for one object type. Under structure and metadata matching, you can configure a

separate path for the respective company for each entry.

Document form: This is where you specify which metadata form to use for documents filed via ELO

Output Link for SAP Business One®. You can enter the same form as in the ELO Integration Client

configuration file, or a separate one for each SAP Business One® object.

Version comment: The comment is entered for the document filed from SAP Business One® and is

visible in the document's feed. If a report or an object is printed again, ELO generates a new

version, which is saved in the comment/feed with the entry configured here.

Delete afterwards: If this option is enabled, a PDF document is deleted after it has successfully

been transferred to ELO.

In detail: If the document comes from the Archived Documents child folder within the attachments

folder, the PDF file there is deleted. If the PDF comes from the attachments folder and it was also

linked on the Attachments tab in the application, the PDF is deleted along with the entry in the SAP

Business One® database.

Only one version: No other versions will be filed. If a document already exists, the previous

metadata remain unchanged.

Structure and metadata matching 

As described in the chapter General settings, when you create an entry under General settings, a

separate entry for the object type is automatically created in the Structure and metadata matching

area.

28 ELO for SAP Solutions



Object type: The entry is copied directly from the General settings area and can also only be

modified in that area.

Repository subpath: The filing path in ELO is defined in the Repository subpath column. In this field,

you can also enter SAP Business One® variables, e.g. using Handlebars syntax.

ELO field matching: This is where you specify how to complete the fields on the metadata form

defined under Document form (see chapter General settings).

ELO field: Choose between GRP for metadata fields and MAP for map fields and enter the technical

name of the field here. In MAP fields, it is possible to use iteration by attaching the value {i} to the

technical name. This is useful in relation to the value in Alternative table if a table of lines is

specified there and multiple values can be transferred. If the metadata fields do not exist in the

metadata form, the corresponding values will be lost and written as a warning in the log.

Value in Handlebars: The value entered here is stored in the corresponding ELO field in the ELO

entry. To copy the value of the transfer parameter from the URL, it must be enclosed in triple curly

brackets.

If the values are iterated, you can use the {i} identifier to indicate the Handlebar.

Please note

If an iteration is defined but there is no {i} in the ELO field, all values will be concatenated

in this field up to a maximum of 255 characters. Any values above this will be rejected.

Key field (expert mode): You can select one key field. The value of the key field is used to specify a

property of the object that remains a unique identifier even when other data changes. For example,

you can specify an ID that uniquely identifies an object. New versions of the object are created at

the new location when moving the object instead of creating it (and therefore a duplicate) at the

old location, for example.

29 ELO for SAP Solutions



Assignment of user and group rights 

Replace rights: ELO inherits the rights of the folder by default. If this option is enabled, the rights of

the folder are discarded and only the set rights are assigned.

Rights for users and groups: Enter the users or groups that you want to assign rights to here.

RWDELP: Use the check boxes to set the different permissions types for users or groups.

R = View

W = Change metadata

D = Delete

E = Edit

L = Edit list

P = Set permissions

For more information, refer to the documentation Concept for assigning rights and permissions.

Installation in SAP Business One® 

After you have completed the configuration in ELO, you have to configure SAP Business One®.

Open SAP Business One® Extension Manager.

Import the ELO for SAP Business One® add-on by clicking Import.

Assign the add-on to the company via the Company Assignment tab.

The settings you are familiar with from the Integration Service have been added to use the

new configPathOl.

Client start 

Start the SAP Business One® client with administrator rights if the client has been started for a

user for the first time or after updates have been installed.

Requirements for printing documents 

Output Link bases its behavior on the system default. This means PDF files with a defined name

structure are expected in the attachments folder in the child folder Archived Documents or in the

main folder. These folders are linked via the document attachments. The PrintEvent also has to be

triggered. If using add-ons or custom developments that work differently or affect the system

behavior, this may impact function in part or completely.

Once Output Link is in use, SAP Business One® should be avoided during ELO maintenance

windows. Otherwise, any failed transfers while the system was unavailable will have to be

repeated manually (see section 'queue' folder). This work may accumulate on different computers

due to the architecture of SAP Business One®.

1. 

2. 

3. 

31 ELO for SAP Solutions



Attachments folder 

A valid path for attachments has to be configured in the connected SAP Business One® system.

This setting should generally be coordinated with a system administrator.

Clients should be able to access the path at all times and the user accounts running the SAP

Business One® client should have read/write and, if necessary, delete rights.

The path is configured here:

Main menu > Modules tab > Administration > System Initialization > General Settings > Path tab

> Attachments folder field

Generate PDF 

For both manual and serial printing, the Generate PDF when printing option has to be enabled. A

PDF with a specific file name is then created in the Archived Documents child folder within the

attachments folder for all print actions.

Example: <object type>_<document number>_<date>_<time>_<report>_<user>.pdf results in 

17_971_20220708_075850_RDR20005_manager.pdf.

If this doesn't happen even though the box has been checked, Output Link will not work.

The option can be set here:

Main menu > Modules tab > Administration > System Initialization > Print Preferences > General

tab > Generate PDF When Printing check box

32 ELO for SAP Solutions



Generate PDF per document 

To generate a PDF when adding a sales order or outgoing invoice and transfer it to ELO, this has to

be configured per document. This configuration generates a PDF, files it to the attachments folder,

and writes an entry to the document's attachments. This function can also be tested without Output

Link.

If there is no entry in the document's attachments after adding the document, Output Link will not

work.

The option can be set here:

Main menu > Modules tab > Administration > System Initialization > Print Preferences > Per

Document tab > Export to PDF

Example for adding a sales order:

33 ELO for SAP Solutions



Optional settings 

If using the Integration Service, you can restrict access to the standard Attachments function for

users. There are different ways to do this. Besides the more complicated option of editing the form

in SAP Business One® Studio, you can also hide the button for adding new attachments in UI edit

mode.

Select Extras > Edit Form UI….

The UI edit mode window opens.

Click Browse and select the Hide menu item.

34 ELO for SAP Solutions



Functionality 

ELO Output Link for SAP Business One® responds to the Application PrintEvent of the SAP Business

One® client. If the object being printed has been configured accordingly, the document is

transferred to ELO and removed in SAP Business One® depending on the configuration.

To transfer a document to ELO, saving of the PDF must be enabled in the configuration.

There are different actions that can trigger the event and creation of a PDF:

Manual printing via the Print button

Serial printing via the Document Printing function (also suitable for subsequent archiving).

Available in: Main menu > Modules tab > Sales > Document Printing > Internal Number From

field > OK button > Print button

35 ELO for SAP Solutions



For certain document actions, such as adding a new document. Different options are

available in SAP Business One® depending on the document type. This depends on what the

system offers.

Example for a sales order:

Troubleshooting 

This chapter features possible solutions for frequent issues.

'AppData' directory 

The add-on creates different folders in the AppData directory of the executing user.

To find the directory, proceed as follows:

In the Windows Explorer Address Bar, enter %appdata% and navigate to the ELO for SAP Business

One® folder.

'log-files' folder 

A log file is written to the log-files folder for each day of the month. It is overwritten completely

when a new month starts. This is a rolling log to keep the hard drive from filling up and to keep the

installation maintenance-free.

You will find the log-files folder in the \AppData > Roaming > ELO for SAP Business One® directory.

37 ELO for SAP Solutions



Debug mode 

Sometimes, a more detailed debug log is required for support reasons. To enable this log, proceed

as follows:

In the ELO for SAP Business One® folder, create a file named DEBUG without an extension,

e.g. via context menu (right-click) > New > Text document.

If the file name extensions are not shown, you will have to enable this option and remove the

extension .txt.

Once the file has been created, restart the add-on or better yet the entire SAP Business One®

client.

'queue' folder 

Internally, Output Link works with a queue to repeat any failed transfers or to continue after a

crash. JSON files that reflect the current status of a transfer are stored in the queue folder. They are

processed and cleaned up automatically.

If the ELO system is down for a longer period of time and SAP Business One® is still used in this

time, you will have to inspect the queue folders for all users. Check whether the error child folder

has been created there and whether it contains entries. If this is the case, you can move the entries

back to the queue folder. Within these files, check whether the RetryCount is greater than 10. It

may have to be set back to the value 0. When the SAP Business One® client (including the ELO

add-on) is started back up, the files are processed.
