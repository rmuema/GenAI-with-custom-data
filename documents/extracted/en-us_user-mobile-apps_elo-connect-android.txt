Requirements and installation 

The ELO Connect app enables you to gather files from different sources and easily transfer them to

the ELO Java Client or ELOoffice. To transfer files, you can access your internal device memory,

removable storage (e.g. SD cards), and cloud storage (e.g. Google Drive).

You can even select the files you want to transfer while on the go. You do not have to be connected

to the same network as the ELO Java Client or ELOoffice.

Requirements 

ELO Connect was developed for use on mobile devices with Android 4.0 or higher. You can transfer

files with ELO Java Client version 11 and higher as well as ELOoffice 11. To install ELO Connect, you

need the Google Play Store app and a Google account.

Please note

Establishing a connection between ELO Connect and your computer requires the port TCP/

UDP 5876 to be enabled. In the Windows Management Console, go to the Windows Defender

Firewall with Advanced Security dialog box and enable port TCP/UDP 5876 under Inbound

Rules. Create a new rule.

As ELO Connect only works on a fixed port, use in a multi-user environment, such as

terminal servers, is not possible.

Method

Tap Install to begin installation.
