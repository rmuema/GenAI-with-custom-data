Information

If you have forgotten your password, contact your system administrator.

If functional roles have been defined for you, you can enable or disable them here.

If you disable your functional roles, all access and user rights associated with the role cannot be

used during the session. This makes it easier to navigate ELO and allows you to focus on tasks

beyond the scope of the role.

Save selection and don't ask again: If you save your selection, you can enable the roles again

under User menu [your name] > Enables roles.

8 ELO Web Client



Program interface

7 Tile navigation: This area is for navigating the program.

9 ELO Web Client



What is a work area? 

ELO contains different work areas. Each work area is used to complete specific tasks. Accordingly,

not all functions are available in every work area.

My ELO: This work area is on the home screen when you start the program. Tiles on the left-

hand side provide access to the main areas in ELO.

Repository: This area contains all folders and documents that you are authorized to access.

This is also where you create additional folders and documents.

Search: This area is where you search for folders and documents that are stored in the 

Repository work area.

Tasks: If you are assigned tasks, you will find them here. Tasks are always related to folders

or documents in the Repository work area.

Clipboard: You can copy frequently used folders and documents from the Repository work

area to the Clipboard. This enables you to quickly find the entries you need frequently or are

currently working on.

In use: When you edit a document, it automatically appears in the In use work area. Editing a

document means that you have checked it out.

'My ELO' work area 

The My ELO work area is on the home screen when you open ELO. Tiles on the left-hand side

provide access to the main areas in ELO.

Tiles are organized into groups.

Edit via the context menu 

Each tile has a context menu that is opened by right-clicking the tile.

You can make the following tile settings within the tile's context menu.

Pin to the navigation bar or Unpin from the navigation bar: This function places the tile on the

navigation bar or removes it. Pinning tiles makes it easier for you to switch between the

work areas.

the color, the icon, and the size of the tile.

You can also enable the following options:

Pinned to the navigation bar: This function places the tile on the navigation bar or removes it.

Pinning tiles makes it easier for you to switch between the work areas.

Show number of entries: If this option is enabled, the tile shows the number of direct child

entries in the work area. If you enable this option for the Repository work area, for example,

only the top folder level will be shown, and not all the entries it contains. This option is

particularly useful in the Tasks work area. If the number next to the Tasks work area is green,

you have at least one new task.

functions are not related to selected entries. Assign substitute or Refresh are examples of functions

that are not contextual.

How do I select multiple entries? 

You can select multiple folders or documents at once to execute a function on all selected entries.

You can only select multiple entries in the viewer pane. The entries must therefore be in the same

folder.

Important actions in detail 

This chapter is especially helpful for new users. It explains how to perform basic actions.

Create new folder 

Before you can file documents, you will need folders in the Repository work area.

There are several ways to create a folder. This chapter describes the function New folder.

Alternatives

Copy: If a folder with the basic structure you need already exists, you can copy this basic

structure without content.

Dynamic folder: This function allows you to create a folder whose content changes

dynamically. The content of a dynamic folder is based on the result of a search. All search

results appear in the folder.

Example

You want to create a folder for a new project your team is working on. Only part of the team is

actively involved the project and should be allowed to store content. The rest of the team should

only have read access.

Method

In the repository, click the folder where you want to create the new folder.

A new folder is always created within the folder you have currently selected. The top level of

your repository is also a folder.

On the ribbon, click New folder on the New tab.

of the editor is shown in square brackets.

A new version of the document is created, which becomes the new working version. The working

version is always the version that you see when you select the document.

The old version is still retained.

given as substitute for Cole.

Enabling the option May forward substitution allows your substitute to pass on the substitution to

another user.

Even in this case, the substitution is not forwarded automatically – the user has to forward it

actively.

Please note

Use this option with caution to prevent rights from being forwarded unintentionally within

the company.

Substitution scope

You can individually configure how many rights you want to give your substitutes.

Substitute inherits everything: Your substitute can see everything that you see.

Restrict substitution: You decide what your substitute is allowed to see.

You must enable at least one of the following three options:

Personal tasks and workflows: If you enable this option, your substitute can access tasks and

workflows that you have been assigned personally, not those given to you as a member of a

group.

Intray access: If you enable this option, your substitute has access to your Intray. The Intray

is only available in the ELO Java Client.

Inherit group membership: Use the drop-down menu to select which of your groups the

substitution applies to. The substitute is assigned the user rights, permissions to entries,

annotations, feed entries, and group tasks associated with the group. This allows you to

create multiple substitutes for the same period and allocate permissions for different groups.

Only the groups that allow substitution are available for selection.

Result

You have set up a substitution. If the substitution period has already begun, the substitution is

already active. Otherwise, the substitution will become active when the defined start date is

reached or the authorized user activates the substitution.

If you are currently being substituted for, you will recognize this by the orange person next to your 

Profile menu [your name].

You will also see on your My ELO start screen that you are being substituted for.

Outlook

A substitution ends

at the end of the defined period, or

if a user substituting for you ends the substitution.

Workspaces 

Workspaces are workspaces in ELO for different functional levels. With the help of filters and

different views, you can edit data and analyze it in charts and tables.

Workspaces are based on workspace types. These are created by administrators and define which

views and filters are available to you. They also define which objects can be created in a

workspace.

Objects 

Objects are a shell with metadata where entries can be compiled. Files and folders can be inserted

in an object.

Connections between objects are not established via a hierarchical structure, but by relations.

The chapter Create object explains how to create an object.

Relations 

You can establish a connection between objects, for example between a job application and the

position it was submitted for.

You establish these connections using relation fields. Relation fields can be found in the metadata

form of an object.

In the table view, a relation is indicated by a button with a chain icon.

If you've entered the corresponding position in the relation field of a job application, for example,

the button with the chain icon takes you from the position to the application. This gives you an

overview of all applications for a position.

Workspace home screen 

Refer to the Spaces section to learn how to access a workspace.

81 ELO Web Client



You can access all the elements of the workspace via the home screen of a workspace. The ribbon

3 Create new object: You can create an object. For more information, refer to the Create object and 

Objects chapters.

4 Switch view: If multiple views have been created for a workspace, you can use the tabs to switch

between views. There are tables and kanban boards. The tabs are named by the administrator and

are customized.

5 Show entry: You can select the chain icon to view entries that are related to the selected entry.

6 Select relation: You can view entries that are related to the selected entry.

7 Edit workspace: You can edit the workspace if you are authorized to do so based on your role.

Folder: You can select which elements of the folder your copy should include.

Click Insert copy.

Metadata 

This function allows you to view the metadata for the entry.

If you have permission, you can edit the metadata. Metadata is data about a folder or a document.

It includes information on the entry itself, such as when it was filed, or its name in the repository. It

also includes the permissions for the entry, meaning which users have what access to the entry.

The quality of a repository depends to a great extent on the quality of the metadata. Metadata

allows you to organize documents in a standardized way and file them quickly to ELO. In addition,

metadata makes it easier to find documents.

A new metadata model was introduced with version ELO 21 in addition to the previous metadata

model. Both models are used in parallel. In the following, these metadata models are referred to as

generation 1 (gen. 1) and generation 2 (gen. 2).

In gen. 2, forms and metadata forms are shown differently in the Metadata dialog box. The

metadata concept will remain the same.

There are three ways to open the Metadata dialog box manually. Select an entry and

The Available forms area lists all the available metadata forms. The list contains either metadata

forms for folders or for documents, depending on the type of entry selected in ELO.

Please note

When you change the metadata form, metadata may be lost or incorrectly assigned.

Fields 

The metadata for a document is entered into fields.

The type of field determines the data you need to enter and what you need to consider when doing

so. There are different types of fields, which can be configured differently from metadata form to

metadata form.

Icons 

If a field contains an icon, this means that ELO helps you to enter content in the field.

The following tools are available:

Keyword list

135 ELO Web Client



Drop-down menu

Calendar

Clock

Relation

Keyword lists 

Fields with keyword lists are used to standardize entries as they only allow you to enter predefined

values.

To open the keyword list, click the keyword list icon. Navigate the list and select a keyword using

the mouse or the up and down keys. Alternatively, you can type a keyword in the field. You will be

offered possible keywords in the drop-down menu.

Keyword lists (gen. 1)

There are two types of fields with keyword lists in gen. 1 metadata forms:

You have to select an entry from the keyword list.

You can select an entry from the keyword list or you can type in your own entry.

If you click a field and a keyword list appears, you cannot make entries.

To open the keyword list, click the keyword list icon. Navigate the list using the mouse or the up

and down keys.

To edit the keyword list, right-click a keyword list entry.

• 

• 

136 ELO Web Client



You can add new keyword list entries or child entries via the context menu and edit or delete

existing ones.

The following options are also available:

Merge keyword: If a keyword has child entries, you can use this option so that the child entries are

always inserted into the field together with the parent keyword. The parent keyword option must be

enabled for this to work.

For example , if your keyword list contains the keyword Invoice with the child entries Miller and 

Smith, either the expression Invoice Miller or Invoice Smith will be used. You can only choose

between the child entries of the keyword.

137 ELO Web Client



Disable keyword: Use this option to deactivate a keyword. The keyword can no longer be selected

and will be grayed out.

For fields without a keyword list, press F7 to open a list of previous entries to the selected fields.

Navigate the list using the mouse or the up and down keys.

Relations 

Relation type fields are used to link a field with the metadata of another entry.

Clicking the chain icon opens a list of entries. Navigate the list using the mouse or arrow keys.

Sort the list using the drop-down menu next to the column headers.

Select the entry you want to link. Clicking the chain icon takes you straight from the metadata of

the entry to the metadata of the linked entry.

If you right-click the field in the metadata for the entry, you can open the filing location of the

linked entry by clicking Go to (closes all windows). Using this function closes the Metadata dialog

box. For this reason, you should only use this function after saving the entry.

138 ELO Web Client



Tabs 

Metadata forms are divided into tabs. There are several default tabs:

Metadata (called Basic in gen. 1 metadata forms)

Extra text (only in gen. 1 metadata forms)

Options

Permissions

The default tabs are briefly described in the following section. Additional tabs appear depending on

the settings in the metadata form.

'Metadata' or 'Basic' tab 

In gen. 1 metadata forms, the Basic tab contains the following default fields:

Short name: The short name is the name of the entry that is shown in the tree structure in the 

Repository work area.

Date:

For documents: In this field, the date on which a document was created or most recently

edited appears automatically. If you want to change the date to the day you file the

document, check the box next to the Adjust document date (set to today) option. If you do

not enable this option, you will see the date on which the document was created under Date,

and the date the document was filed to ELO is shown under Filing date. Another term for the

date is Document date.

For folders: You can select a date of your choice for this field.

For folders only:

ELOINDEX: This field is for the filing definition. When filing documents automatically, ELO identifies

where to file the document through the ELOINDEX.

'Extra text' tab

139 ELO Web Client



In this text field, you can enter information that is not covered by the other fields, for example a

more exact description or a comment. The field can also be used for script settings.

'Options' tab 

The Options tab is where you specify the characteristics and behavior of an entry. Depending on

whether you are entering metadata for a document or a folder, different settings will be displayed.

You will find more information on the Personal identifier, End of deletion period, and End of

retention period fields in the chapter Identify personal data.

Entry type: This option defines the type of entry. The icon of the entry is displayed in the list view in

ELO according to the settings made here.

Font color: Select a color for the entry to highlight it in your repository structure.

Starting point for replication: If this option is enabled, you only replicate the selected entry and not

the parent folders. This option allows you to replicate parts of repositories that are not stored in

identical repository structures. First, you have to enable this option and then assign the folder to a

replication set (Ribbon > Organize > Properties > Assign replication sets). You will find more

information in the chapter Assign replication sets.

Information

If you configure this option for documents, the parent folder is still replicated.

For folders only:

Sort order: Define the sort order of the contents of the corresponding folder in the Sort order field. If

you select Manual, you can move entries within the folder manually. To sort the contents of a folder

manually, select the folder in the tree view. In the viewer pane, click the entry you want to move

and drag it to the position where you want it.

Enable quick preview for documents in the folder: Use this option to view the first document in a

folder in the viewer pane as soon as you click the folder.

For documents only:

Document status: In the Document status field, you can configure how the document behaves in

the event of changes.

Version control disabled: Only one version of the document is stored. A new version replaces

the previous version. The previous version is deleted and is no longer available.

• 

140 ELO Web Client



Important

If you select this option, the previous version is overwritten each time you save. The View >

Document > Versions > Load new version function overwrites the current version without

creating a new one. Therefore, we do not recommend using this option.

Version control enabled: If the document is changed, the previous versions are saved. The

versions of a document can be restored.

Non-modifiable: Neither the document nor the associated metadata can be edited.

Important

The status Non-modifiable cannot be reversed.

Encryption key: This field is completed automatically depending on the selected metadata form

and cannot be changed.

Add to full text database: Enable this option to add the document to the full text database. This

function indexes words so that they are available in the search.

File name: The previous name of the document is entered into this field automatically. The name

you entered as the Short name on the Metadata or Basic tab is the one shown in the repository, and

not this name.

'Permissions' tab 

The users and groups that have access rights to the selected entry are listed on the Permissions

tab. Users with the corresponding rights are able to change the settings.

• 

• 

141 ELO Web Client



User/group: You can also select the options Owner permissions and Parent permissions from the

drop-down menu. If you select Owner permissions, you assign yourself all the rights to the folder or

document. Owner permissions can be transferred, such as when you leave the company. Select the 

Parent permissions option to assign the new folder or document the same rights as its parent entry.

Select permissions: To edit the permissions settings for a selected user or group, select the user or

group and then enable or disable individual options.

The following options are available:

View (R): Users have read access to the entry. They cannot change the entry, but they can

add margin notes.

Change metadata (W): Users can edit the metadata of the entry.

Delete (D): Users can delete the entry.

Edit (E) (documents only): Users can edit the selected entry. This means they can check out

the document, load a new version, and change the working version.

Options that are not applicable are shown in italics and enclosed in pointy brackets.

Personal: Use this button to assign yourself sole access to the respective entry. If other users or

groups had permissions, they are removed.

AND group: To create an AND group, select two groups in the middle column and click AND group.

AND groups only give permissions to the users who are members of both groups.

Permissions for entries in spaces 

There are additional authorization options for entries that were created in a space.

With the default settings, users have the permissions for these entries they were granted according

to their roles in the space.

You can find more information on spaces in the Spaces section.

143 ELO Web Client



You can grant users who are not members of a space access to entries in the space. Users can open

these entries from the search or with ELO links, for example.

Example 1

A user needs to be able to read and edit the metadata of an entry create in a workspace. Add the

user on the Permissions tab and assign the user R and W permissions.

You can also set permissions for specific entries separately in the space to restrict access to the

entries.

Authorization only for members of the space<space name>: Users and groups granted this

permission can only access the entry if they are members of the corresponding space.

Information

This option only appears for entries created in a space. For entries created elsewhere but

displayed in a space, the permissions of the entry in the repository apply.

144 ELO Web Client



If you enable this option for users or groups, they are granted the permissions for entries in a space

according to their role in the space.

You can see the permissions in effect when you select a user or group in the Metadata dialog box.

Example 2

A user has the Member role in a workspace. Members have RWDEL permissions for entries. The

user is also a member of the Team leader group. In the Metadata dialog box, this group has all

permissions for the entry.

The user only has RWDEL permissions for this entry because only these permissions overlap.

If you change the permissions of a folder in the Metadata dialog box, the new permissions can be

passed on to the child entries (child folders and documents). After you have changed the

permissions, the Permissions changed dialog box opens. Specify what effects this change should

have.

145 ELO Web Client



Please note

The changes do not affect references, since they retain the permission settings of the

original entry.

Choose from the following options:

Do not pass on permissions: The changes are not applied to the documents and child folders in the

folders.

Pass on permissions to child entries: All permissions are passed on to the entries in the folder.

Only apply changes, keep other permissions: Only permissions are passed on that result in changes

to permissions for the documents and child folders in the folder.

only folders/documents.

Enter metadata with ELO Click OCR 

The integrated text recognition feature can be used as a tool for entering metadata. ELO Click OCR

transfers text from a document into the metadata form. To use this method, you will have to save

the document first. OCR works on TIF documents and in the image preview (Ribbon > View >

Image preview).

Method

Select the document whose metadata you want to edit.

Configure the viewer pane so that you see both the metadata and the document.

To learn how to do this, refer to the Viewer pane chapter.

Click Edit at the bottom of the metadata dialog box.

Click the field you want to copy the value from the document into.

Holding the CTRL key and left mouse button, draw a frame around the information in the

document that you want to use for the metadata.

Information

If you want to transfer multiple terms after another, select each individual term while

holding CTRL + SHIFT + left mouse button. Release the mouse button after each term.

Repeat the process until you have transferred all desired terms.

Release.

ELO Click OCR reads the text contents of the selected area. The recognized text information

is transferred to the selected field.

Information

If you did not select a field, the recognized text is displayed in the OCR dialog box. You can

copy the text you need and paste it to the Clipboard.

Identify personal data 

The Options tab in the Metadata dialog box contains three fields that allow you to find entries with

personal data and delete them in due time.

Personal identifier: If the entry contains a personal identifier, enter information that enables you to

identify the relevant person in this field. This term is intended to help you find the entry using the 

metadata search. For this reason, you need a company-wide system for assigning these terms. This

will help you find entries containing a user's personal data. You can also search all entries

containing personal data – regardless of the individual.

End of deletion period: Enter the date on which the entry must be deleted at the latest. This date

must come after the date you have entered under End of retention period. You can select a date by

clicking the calendar icon in the field.

End of retention period: Enter the date up to which the entry has to be retained. The entry cannot

be deleted before the entered date.

entries with personal data.

For information on how to delete entries with personal data, see the chapter Delete entries

with personal data.

Assign replication sets 

The function Assign replication sets enables you to assign replication sets to entries in ELO.

Replication sets allow you to synchronize data between multiple locations. The replication sets

must have already been mapped to the entries with the ELO Replication module.

configured at the other locations through replication.

the list, this change is passed on to the entry. Replication sets from the list that were not

changed are not passed on. The replication sets of the entry that were not changed are

retained.

overlap are removed.

Including child entries: If this option is enabled, the replication set is also assigned to the

child entries of the selected entry.

owner of.

Any node: If this option is enabled, you only see workflows in which the selected user/group

is the editor of at least one node.

Active node: If this option is enabled, you only see workflows in which the selected user/

group is entered as the editor of the node.

Start date: With the From and To fields, you can specify how long you want the workflow to be

Information

Workflows cannot be deleted from the Tasks work area. Workflows have to be forwarded.

Whether you can delete folders or documents depends on your permissions.

Important

removed from ELO permanently by an administrator. They can be restored until the point at

which they are permanently deleted.

Alternative:

Depending on the settings, the folders or documents are automatically removed from ELO as soon

'Search' tab 

This tab only appears when you are in the Search work area.

It contains functions that help you run a search or use a finished search.

For a description of the Search work area, refer to the chapter 'Search' work area.

You can see an example of a search in the chapter Search entries.

Filters 

Filters and facets allow you to narrow down your search using metadata, such as the filing date.

Filters and facets work in the same way. The only difference is how they are selected.

To learn how to select a facet, refer to the Narrow down search chapter.

To select a filter, on the ribbon, click Search > Filter and select the desired filter. After you have

selected the filter, specify the filter via the drop-down menu. To select a filter that has already been

selected again, click the name of the selected filter.

'Date' and 'Filing date' filters

You can select a specific date or period of time using the drop-down menu.

Alternatively, you can enter a date (DD.MM.YYYY) or period of time in the field.

Enter period of time:

• 

174 ELO Web Client



Time: Enter a minus to search in the past. Enter a plus to search in the future. Additionally,

enter a number that determines the length of the period of time.

Unit: If you only enter a number in addition to the minus or plus sign, the unit searched for is 

days. If you put an m after the number, the unit searched for is months.

Examples: -14 searches for all entries in the last 14 days. -6m searches for all entries in the

last six months.

Negate filters

You can apply reverse filters. For example, if you select a user and set the filter to is not, only

entries that were not processed by this editor are shown. It is not possible to only negate individual

filters or facets.

To negate a selected filter, right-click the filter and then click is not.

Set as default

This function saves your current search settings as the default. The default is restored when you

reset the search.

Search in areas 

You can limit your search to specific areas.

Configure this setting in the In x areas menu.

If you have selected multiple areas, the search behaves as follows:

• 

• 

175 ELO Web Client



One search term:

If you enter one search term in the search field, entries containing the search term in one of

the areas are shown.

Multiple search terms:

AND search: With an AND search (entering terms without a connecting element, for example 

dog cat), all entries that contain all search terms in one of the searched areas are shown.

OR search: With an OR search (entering terms with a comma, for example dog, cat), all

entries that contain at least one search term in one of the searched areas are shown.

Current folder only

You can narrow down the search to a single folder.

For technical reasons, this option may cause the search results to take a long time to load.

Method

In the Repository work area, select the folder you want to search.

Switch to the Search work area.

On the ribbon, click Search > In x areas > Current folder only.

Configure the additional search settings.

Add favorite 

You can create search favorites for searches you need frequently.

A search favorite creates a tile on your My ELO home screen that allows you to immediately launch

a previously defined search.

Method

In the Search work area, configure the desired search settings.

On the ribbon, click Search > Search favorites > Add favorite.

Enter a meaningful name for the search favorite and save it.

Click My ELO.

Result

You will find your new tile in the Hidden tiles area.

Drag the tiles to the desired group.

You will also find your search favorites in the Search work area on the ribbon under Search >

Search favorites.

Outlook

You can overwrite or delete a search favorite.

Overwrite: To overwrite a search favorite, enter the changed search settings in the Search

work area. If the search favorite includes many settings and you only want to change a few,

you can click the tile and perform the search. This way, you only need to make the changes

and don't have to enter all settings. On the ribbon, click Search > Search favorites > [Name

of the search favorite] > Overwrite.

Delete: To delete a search favorite, on the ribbon, click Search > Search favorites > [Search

favorite name] > Delete.

Search metadata 

You can search the metadata of folders or documents.

This search is not as precise as the ELO iSearch but can provide faster results.

The metadata search allows you to specifically search for entries containing personal data.

Method

On the ribbon, click Search > Search logic > Search metadata.

Select which metadata you want to search. You have the following options:

•

All metadata forms: If you don't know which metadata form was used to file the entry, use

the Search form. All metadata forms are searched.

form. Only the selected metadata form is searched.

Click Search.

Result

The results of your search are shown in the Search work area.

Outlook

To return to ELO iSearch, click Reset search (red arrow button at the top right).

To create a dynamic folder with your search, use the Dynamic folder function.

Click Search.

Result

Outlook

For information on how to delete entries with personal data, see the chapter Delete entries with

Dynamic folder 

Dynamic folders are folders whose contents change automatically. The contents of a dynamic

folder are based on the results of a search. References to the search results are stored in dynamic

folders.

Method

Perform a search.

On the ribbon, click Results > Dynamic folder.

In the folder Create dynamic folder, click to select a target folder for your dynamic folder.

Click OK.

Enter metadata for the dynamic folder.

Click OK.

Result

The dynamic folder is created at the selected filing location. The current results of the search are

immediately created as a reference.

Outlook

The references automatically appear in or disappear from the dynamic folder if the search

returns other results.

You can also delete folders that you no longer need.

Remove from search results 

You can remove individual entries from your search results.

Method

Perform a search.
