3 ELO packages



Do not delete any groups that have already been used in ELO. This can lead to inconsistencies. In

this case, it is better to change the basic settings of the group instead of deleting the group:

Disable Visible in user lists

The group now only exists in the background in ELO. The rights assigned via the group are

maintained and previous actions with this group, such as participation in workflows, are still visible

in ELO.

Configuration 

Define basic settings 

In the Basic settings area, you define the Group information, Properties, and additional Information.

Group information 

Name: Mandatory field. This can be changed later.

E-mail address: Displayed in the user profile in the client and can be used in workflows,

forms, and scripts.

Administrator: The name of the account used to create the new group is automatically

entered. This can be changed later. Determines who can edit the master data of the group.

Supervisor: Can be used in workflows, forms, and scripts. If this field is left blank, the content

of the Name field is used.

Use:

Visible in user lists: If this option is enabled, the group will show up in dialog boxes in

the ELO client. If the option is disabled, the group still exists in ELO, but users without

administrator privileges are unable to select them in dialog boxes.

Option group: Option groups are defined for the purpose of assigning specific 

ProfileOpts. Only these groups show up in dialog boxes where settings are made for

other ELO accounts.

whether they want to assume the functional role for the current session. This allows users to

decide whether they want to use ELO in a specific role.
