Basics 

What is ELO Teamroom? 

ELO Teamroom acts as a platform for collaboration across teams. It enables multiple parties to

collaborate even if not all members have access to the initiator's main repository. This could be

different companies, such as associations in the construction sector, but it can also be relevant

within the company if different departments have their own repositories. A lean ELO Teamroom

Client that runs in a web browser also provides all users with basic functions such as searching,

filing, and showing entries.

Target audience 

This manual is addressed to ELO Teamroom users. Separate documentation is available for

administrators.

The scope of functions presented in this documentation may differ greatly from those in your

client.

If you do not find functions described in this documentation in your client, you do not have

permission to perform the action.

chapters are a good place to start:

functions are not related to selected entries. Refresh is an example of a non-contextual function.
