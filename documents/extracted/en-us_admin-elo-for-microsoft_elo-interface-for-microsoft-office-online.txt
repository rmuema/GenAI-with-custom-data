ELO Interface for Microsoft Office Online

Introduction 

Please note

To use ELOimo, you need a Microsoft Office Online Server. Microsoft Office Online Server

must be self-hosted. It cannot connect to Microsoft Office 365.

ELOimo acts as an interface between the Microsoft Office Online Server (using the WOPI protocol)

and the ELO Indexserver. Ensure that the firewalls are properly configured so that Microsoft Office

Online Server and the ELO Indexserver can access each other.

Installation of Microsoft Office Online Server 

You will find the installation instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/officeonlineserver/

deploy-office-online-server.

When configuring in a test environment, we recommend configuring two zones: "internal-http" and

"external-https" so that both the HTTP URL and the HTTPS URL are available for testing purposes.

You can check if Microsoft Office Online Server is properly installed/configured by going to the

following page: http(s)://<server-url>/hosting/discovery. You should see the following there:

In a production environment, we recommend installing Microsoft Office Online Server on a separate

server. However, for testing purposes it is also possible to run everything on the same server.

Installation of ELOimo 

ELOimo is independent from the ELO Indexserver, meaning that you only need to install one

ELOimo module for multiple ELO Indexserver instances. The ELOix proxy plug-ins can redirect to

ELOimo. This setting is configured automatically during the ELO server installation.

To install ELOimo, go to the Applications tab of the setup. Click the button Add ELO Interface for

Microsoft Office Online.

Configuration 

Please note

If you make any changes to the configuration, you will need to reload the web app.

Configuration file 

A configuration file might look like this:

# Indicates where the "discovery URL" of the Office Online Server is

discoveryUrl = http://oo.ex16.local/hosting/discovery

# Possible values depending on HTTP/HTTPS and your Office Online configuration:

# - internal-http

# - external-https

zone = internal-http

# The favored view in the Office Online Server

# Possible values are:

# - "embedview": an embedded view with minimal options

# - "view": has a Microsoft toolbar included

viewType = embedview

# ELO Clients only select the language.

# However, different countries (using the same language) might use different formats (for example "." or ",

# For some Office Apps, such as Microsoft Excel, you have to define the full locale.

# Locales for "de-DE", "en-US", and "fr-FR" are predefined but can be overridden this way.

locales.en = en-UK

# This collaborative user is used to check in documents edited in collaborative sessions.

# It should exist in every ELO Indexserver using this module and have the same password.

# It also checks in "temporary save" documents if the user's session was abruptly terminated.

collabUsername = ELO Service

collabPassword = cleartext-or-elo-encrypted

# The "public" URL for this module.

# Especially useful if behind a proxy.

selfUrl = http://localhost:8080

# Path where documents are stored temporarily

dataPath = ./temp

Check configuration 

You can check whether the configuration is correct on the following pages:

http(s)://<elo-server>/imo/status

http(s)://<elo-server>/ix-<repository>/plugin/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy/imo/status

Both URLs should take you to the same status page. If the second link returns an "HTTP Status 404"

error, make sure that the file "<elo>/config/ix-…/…/de.elo.ix.plugin.proxy.properties" contains an

entry like this:

/imo/=http\://…/imo/

Keep in mind that the URL ends with /imo/ and not /imo-<repository-name>.

# Deprecated

#defaultIxUrl = http://localhost:9090/ix-ELO/ix

HTTPS/certificates 

If the ELO Web Client is configured with HTTPS, the configured zone must also be ...-https.

Otherwise, it will not be displayed in the ELO Web Client for security reasons.

The ELO server does not use the Windows Certificate Store but instead uses its own. If you use a

self-signed certificate with Microsoft Office Online Server, you should share this certificate with the

ELO server. This is also the case if both are on the same server.

To upload a trustworthy certificate to the ELO server, we recommend you use the following tool: 

https://keystore-explorer.org/.

There is no password for the store. Leave the field blank.

Functions 

The ELOimo module enables users to access a Microsoft Office Online Server from ELO. In the ELO

Java Client, you can view Microsoft Office documents as a web preview. In the ELO Web Client, you

can open Microsoft Office documents within your browser and edit them alone or in collaboration

with other users.

You will find these functions in the ELO Web Client under Ribbon > Document.

Edit in Office: This function enables you to open Microsoft Office documents directly in Microsoft

Office.

Information

Microsoft 2010 with Service Pack 1 is required at minimum.

A new version is created automatically in ELO when you save the Microsoft Office document. This

way, you do not need to upload the document after you are done editing it.

Edit online: This function allows you to open and edit Microsoft Office documents online. The

document is opened in a new browser tab. While the user is editing the document, it is marked as

checked out. Once you close the tab containing the document, the changes are saved.

Collaborate: This function allows you to open Microsoft Office documents online and work on them

with other users. The document is opened in a new browser tab. While the user is editing the

document, it is marked as checked out. If multiple users are editing the document, the user ELO

Service is shown as the editor. Once you close the tab containing the document, the changes are

saved.

FAQ 

When/how are changes to documents saved?

Temporary files are stored by the ELOimo web app. Once all users have finished editing the

document and closed the browser tab, the document will be filed as a new version.

If multiple users have edited the document, the special collaborative user configured as 

collabUsername will be used to save the new version.

Is Microsoft OneNote supported?

Microsoft OneNote is not supported as it requires additional protocols beyond the scope of this

module.

Is Microsoft Visio supported?

Microsoft Visio is not included as part of the Microsoft Office Online Server and is only available in

Microsoft Office 365.

Why can't I see/edit some Word/Excel files properly?

Since 2018, Microsoft's on-premises Office Online Server is only being maintained and is no longer

under development. Older and newer Word documents may contain features that are not supported

by the on-premises Office Online Server, which means they have to be edited in other ways.

Why is the document not checked in immediately after editing?

Since the start of 2020, fundamental changes to browser behavior mean that they no longer trigger

an event when a page is closed. As a result, the system does not know when exactly the document

should be checked in again. This is why the document is checked in after one or two minutes of

inactivity.
