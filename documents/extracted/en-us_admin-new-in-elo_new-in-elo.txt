Base technology 

Metadata (gen. 2) 

With aspects, relations, and inheritance, the new second generation metadata model

supports efficient modeling of complex scenarios and enables the visualization of large

volumes of data.

Metadata forms in the new metadata module (gen. 2) are made up of aspects.

Aspects are groups of related fields, such as street, postal code, city, and country for an

address.

The same aspects can be used multiple times in one metadata form.

There are no quantity restrictions in metadata fields.

All metadata can be searched.

Metadata forms can be inherited. This helps you quickly create similar/extended metadata

forms based on an existing one.

Metadata is shown and edited in forms (gen. 2). Different views can be used for different

uses. This results in a standardized appearance across all clients.

The existing and new data models will work in parallel, metadata forms can still be used,

and old data does not have to be converted currently.

In addition to the established field types, the metadata model (gen. 2) also includes the field

types User, Relation, URL, E-mail, Selection list, and Check box.

The metadata model (gen. 2) in version 21.3 features additional data/field types.

The metadata model now features dashboard views.

New in ELO 23.0 

Keyword lists with new translation logic are available as packages.

Parent metadata forms are used.

Forms (gen. 2) can be used in workflows.

For more information, refer to the Metadata (gen. 2) documentation.

Forms (gen. 2) 

The forms (gen. 2) offer a flexible, modern interface and enable you to display and edit

metadata (gen. 2).

Forms (gen. 2) are the foundation for a standardized metadata view in all clients.

The forms (gen. 2) are responsive, automatically enabling different views for different

devices (desktop monitor, tablet, smartphone).

The usual structured layout with headers and tabs is still possible, now complemented with

form blocks that can be shown and hidden. You can also easily create lists in the form of a

table.

In the new form designer, you can create different views using drag-and-drop and combine

them to build more complex forms.

Field types (IBAN, URL, e-mail) are validated using regular expressions.

The new forms will initially remain in parallel to the existing forms but will replace the

existing workflow forms in the medium term.

In addition to the established field types, the forms (gen. 2) also include the field types User, 

Relation, URL, E-mail, Selection list, and Check box.

The form designer now includes the option to create dashboards.

New in ELO 23.0 

Keyword lists with new translation logic are available as packages.

Parent metadata forms are used.

Forms (gen. 2) can be used in workflows.

For more information, refer to the Forms (gen. 2) documentation.

Packages & transport 

Related configurations are combined into individual packages, enabling easy installation and 

transfer between systems, e.g. of an entire ELO Business Solution.

Packages form the foundation for transferring solutions or custom developments to different

systems (development, test, or production system).

Packages can be created on different levels. Currently, the levels Basic, Custom, and Staging

are available.

Packages can be created, edited, deleted, imported and exported in the ELO Administration

Console.

Packages are based on Metadata forms, Aspects, and Forms. The following components can

be added: 

ELO Flows

Workspaces

Teamspaces

Import and export translations

Groups with corresponding rights and role management

Markers in the ELO Administration Console for adjustments to workspace templates

Workspaces 

The workspaces use custom dynamic filters to provide access to business objects. Users can

also directly access other related objects.

Workspaces are invisible folders within ELO that contain different object types and are 

displayed independent of the tree view.

Different visualizations are available for different user groups, e.g. a table view and Kanban

boards.

Dashboards are available to visualize metadata.

You can search for objects within a workspace.

New in ELO 23.0

entries in the workspace.

client library from ELO 21, the new error code ELOIX:3008 is returned.

The new optiondisableCacheSync disables cache synchronization, which can make sense for

development environments.

The number of registered OCR workers is output on the status page.
